EXODUS
So, a couple of months down the road, we planned this epic celebration for Sandra's birthday. Agape, being the social butterfly she is, invited everyone from our close-knit circle, and that, of course, included Lillian. We had even given ourselves a cheesy but endearing title – the "Fresh Family."

Now, picture this: It's the day of the birthday bash, and the weather gods decide to sprinkle a bit of rain on our parade. I thought, "Hey, Lillian might need some cover from the rain." So, without much thought, I handed her my leather jacket to shield her from the drizzle. Little did I know, a simple act of kindness would set off a storm of envy that would reshape the dynamics of our tight-knit group. 

Agape and her gang, instead of appreciating my impromptu gesture, weren't exactly thrilled about the special treatment Lillian got. Imagine the awkward glances, raised eyebrows, and fake vibes that felt like a stormy cloud over our Fresh Family celebration.

The party went on, the cake was cut, and the jealous looks continued. Picture this scene: fake smiles plastered on faces, laughter that didn't quite reach the eyes, and an undercurrent of envy lingering beneath the surface.

As the jealous looks continued, they couldn't hide the envy that brewed within. Lillian, unsuspecting and genuine, faced this sea of fake camaraderie while the storm of envy raged quietly.

Days later, the plot thickened. The members of the Fresh Family approached me with a surprising proposition. They decided to hit Lillian with a heavy blow – she was kicked out of the Fresh Family. They seriously wanted Lillian out of the squad. 

Yep, you heard it right. The envy was so real that they decided she was no longer fit to be part of our cheesy-but-lovable crew. Talk about a plot twist in the Fresh Family saga! The irony? They smiled in her face at the party but schemed an evil plot behind her back. Oh, the comedy of errors!

Approached by the majority, I reluctantly agreed to the decision of removing her from the Fresh Family. Caught in the whirlwind of peer pressure, I, too, surrendered to the majority vote. So, there I was, unknowingly caught in the web of envy and peer pressure. I never realised that in trying to preserve the atmosphere of harmony, I was unintentionally contributing to the destruction of our once-tight group. Lillian, my unsuspecting cornerstone, was ousted from the Fresh Family.

In the aftermath, I found myself in a whirlwind of regret. The majority had spoken, and I went along with it, only to realize later the true treasure I had let slip away. Little did I know, in kicking out Lillian, I was dismissing the very cornerstone that would have added strength and depth to our Fresh Family. The builders may have ignored the stone, but life, in its unpredictable brilliance, had other plans. As the dust settled, and the consequences of my wrong decision unfolded, I began to see the true value of what I had lost. Had I known the true value of what I was kicking out, I would have chosen a different path. 

In my alternative daydream, I imagined a scenario where I kicked out the troublemakers and kept Lillian as the lone member of our Fresh Family crew. The thought of navigating the Fresh Family dynamics with just her brought a smile to my face. Life, being the unpredictable storyteller it is, had me imagining these scenarios that were both hilarious and heartwarming.

It taught me that sometimes what appears to be ordinary can hold extraordinary value. Little did I know, the cornerstone I had unwittingly dismissed would soon reenter the stage, ready to redefine the dynamics of our story. Life, with its unpredictable script, was teaching me a lesson about the true worth of what I had unwittingly dismissed.
