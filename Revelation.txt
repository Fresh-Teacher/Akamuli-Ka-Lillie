REVELATION
"Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone?" The Reverend, with an air of authority, snapped the Bible shut, with his eyes fixed on me. 

My heart did a little cha-cha in my chest. Panic mode ON! I started fidgeting, thinking he was personally interrogating me. What do I say? Do I confidently proclaim, "Yes, I've read the scriptures," risking a follow-up question about the specific book and verse? Or do I humbly admit, "No, I didn't read the scriptures," but risk looking like the Biblical Black Sheep in front of the entire congregation, including those judgmental kids who probably knew the Bible better than I did? 

The internal memory debate was real. Panic alert! Many options flashed before my eyes like a multiple-choice quiz in a high-stakes exam. 
A) Act like a Deputy Jesus and say yes but pray that he doesn't ask you more scriptures. 
B) Admit that you don't know and be shamed in front of the congregation. 
C) Invent an elaborate excuse such as a sudden sickness of spiritual amnesia.

This is how it all started: I was sitting in church minding my own business. Or, well, maybe half-listening might be a more accurate description. My mind was doing its own thingy; it was more like 50% attention and 50% daydreaming – probably still thinking about the good time I had spent with Lillian when she visited our home in Masaka. Suddenly, the preacher locked eyes with me and dropped the spiritual bomb: "Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone?"

Cue the heart skipping a beat, or maybe a few. I started fidgeting, wondering if he was singling me out of the entire congregation. Was he speaking to me? Panic mode activated!

But oh no, it didn't end there. The preacher, with a look of divine determination, descended from the pulpit and started making a beeline towards me. Now, my heart was doing a marathon – 10 heartbeats per second, if that's even scientifically possible.

When the preacher drew closer, my palms started to get a little sweaty, and I shifted uncomfortably in my seat so I decided to stand up and answer his question. As I stood up, preparing my response and trying to come up with something spiritual and sensible, the entire congregation turned to look at me, all eyes locked on me like I was the chosen one (or the guilty one, hard to tell). As the preacher closed in, I could feel the eyes of the congregation fixated on me. Kids were looking with innocent curiosity, and adults were probably placing bets on how this drama would end.

And there I stood, contemplating the age-old question: to admit or not to admit? The preacher, now right in front of me, gently touched my shoulder and gives me a nudge to sit back down. And then, with a twinkle in his eyes, he said "Our reading came from Matthew 21:42."

And just like that, I sat back down, slightly embarrassed for standing up yet the preacher was just reading a Bible verse but not asking us for an answer.

NOTE TO SELF: always pay more attention in church; you never know when the preacher might decide to drop a scriptural bomb with your name on it. 

The Scriptures echoed in my mind, like a melody you can't shake off. The old wooden pews seemed to absorb the weight of those words, and as the familiar hymns started to play, I couldn't help but feel a shift in the atmosphere. 

The church service, with its creaky pews and sunlight streaming through stained glass, had an air of familiarity. The Reverend, with his booming voice and a Bible clutched in his hands, took center stage. As he delved into the scripture, I couldn't help but be drawn in. As the preacher went on about how Jesus, the underestimated stone, became the key to everything, I found my mind drifting. Suddenly, the church pews transformed into my own personal arena of reflection. 

See, I'd been doing some rejecting myself, not with religious stones but with matters of the heart. In the corridors of relationships, I had been wrestling with my own precious stones, deliberately ignoring the cornerstone – Lillian. I had been busy choosing the wrong stones, hoping they would fit into the puzzle of my life. The echoes of heartache reverberated in the spaces between the pews, and I couldn't help but think about the twists and turns of my romantic journey.

And so, I had sought opinions from those I trusted. My parents, the first advisors in matters of love, gave a resounding go-ahead for Lillian. Bob, the seasoned sage of relationships, went a step further, suggesting I take Lillian as my fiancée. It seemed like the stars were aligning for Lillian to be the cornerstone of my life. 

The next step was to ask God himself. With a heart heavy with confusion, I poured out my thoughts to God, seeking divine guidance to reveal whether Lillian was the right cornerstone or if there was another piece to complete the puzzle of my heart. In the quiet sanctuary, amidst the hymns and the sunlight filtering through the stained glass, I awaited a sign from above, trusting that the answer would be unveiled in due time.

The preacher's words echoed in my head – "Have you never read in the Scriptures..." – and it hit me like a ton of bricks. Just like Jesus was overlooked and became the cornerstone, there she was – Lillian, the silent cornerstone of my love story. As the Reverend spoke about overlooking the crucial stone, my mind wandered to Lillian, my constant companion. I had been so busy chasing after fleeting connections, blind to the cornerstone standing right beside me. 

As the church settled into its usual rhythm, my mind couldn't shake the connection between ancient wisdom and the complexity of my own love story. In that sacred space, surrounded by worn-out pews and the soft glow of stained glass, I found myself lost in thought.

And bam! Revelation time – Lillian, my constant, my anchor, was the overlooked cornerstone in the blueprint of my life. In the quiet of that church, surrounded by echoes of devotion, it felt like the universe was nudging me to wake up.

The realisation hit me like a divine lightning bolt – Lillian, my rock, my constant companion, was the cornerstone I had overlooked. In the quiet of the church, where sunlight filtered through the stained glass, I felt the weight of this revelation settle over me. It was as if the universe conspired to whisper a truth I had been blind to. There, in the quiet of the church, I realized that my journey of love had been akin to overlooking the cornerstone right in front of me. The gravity of this realization settled over me, transforming an ordinary Sunday into the commencement of a profound chapter.

Ever had that feeling like someone's telling your life story in a sermon? Well, that's exactly where I found myself. That Sunday's sermon felt like a divine intervention, and if you've ever been there, you know exactly what I mean. So, picture this – the Reverend closes the Bible and gives you a knowing look. Picture it: me, lost in a sea of thoughts, connecting the dots between ancient scriptures and my own love saga. Ever felt like they're talking about your messy love life? This was one of those times.

The rejected stone becoming the cornerstone – classic Sunday School wisdom, right? But this time, it hit different. It was as if the universe decided to tap me on the shoulder and say, "Hey, buddy, pay attention." Ever had a moment where you realize you've been missing the point all along? That was my Sunday morning.

There I was in the pew, the atmosphere buzzing with whispered prayers and the faint scent of incense. The whole rejected cornerstone dilemma began to forge into something more personal. As the congregation swayed to the hymns, my mind was on a wild ride. So, if you've ever sat in a church pew, questioning your life choices during a sermon, welcome to the club.

The rejected stone sermon stuck to my mind like glue, refusing to let go. As the church service unfolded, I found myself on a mental loop, connecting the dots between the cornerstone concept and my own entangled love story.

On the way home from church, the rhythm of my thoughts kept echoing that Sunday revelation. The street corners seemed to whisper the words, "rejected stone," as if the universe reminded to keep the message alive.

The whole day became a playground for contemplation. Whether I was sipping a cup of tea or typing away at my desk, the rejected stone mantra played in the background, like an ever-present soundtrack to my thoughts. Ever had a day where a single idea kidnaps your brain? This was my version.

Lillian's face kept popping up, like a romantic reminder saying, "Hey, buddy, did you get the memo?" How many times did I miss the memo while chasing after shiny distractions? How many times had I overlooked her, chasing after shadows while she stood, steadfast and unnoticed, in the background?

It was like living in a real-life replay, where the rejected stone story became the lens through which I viewed my choices. The ordinary became extraordinary, and every mundane moment held a whisper of revelation.

As the sun dipped below the horizon and the day turned into night, I found myself staring at the stars, still lost in this rejected stone maze. In the quiet of the night, with the rejected stone thoughts still on repeat, I tossed and turned. It was like the universe had handed me a puzzle, and every twist and turn in my love story suddenly made sense. It was like a puzzle, and every piece fell into place as I retraced my steps through the day.

Lillian's name, intertwined with the concept of the cornerstone, became my silent companion in the darkness. The realisation hit me – how could I have missed the cornerstone of my own love story? Even as I closed my eyes, dreams were a swirl of Lillian and rejected stones. It was like the universe was dropping hints in my sleep. The irony hit me – the rejected stone was now the star of my midnight musings.

As the clock ticked away, I found myself questioning every decision, every missed opportunity. Did I reject the cornerstone for glittering stones that promised brilliance but crumbled under disappointment? The weight of those thoughts lingered, shaping the contours of my reflections.

Even in the quiet moments before sleep claimed me, the rejected stone persisted. It was like a friendly ghost, nudging me to confront the choices that had brought me to this pivotal crossroads. The irony of it all – the cornerstone of my life being the one I had somehow overlooked.

Morning rolled around, bringing with it the residue of the rejected stone revelations from the night before. The sun painted the sky with hues of dawn, but my mind was still dancing with the rejected stone mantra. Ever wake up feeling like your brain has been active even while asleep? That was me.

As I sipped my morning coffee, the rejected stone theme continued its relentless play. It was like the universe had gifted me a mental playlist, and Lillian's name was front and center. 

Work became a backdrop to this rejected stone symphony. Emails, meetings, and the daily tasks felt strangely different. Every decision I made seemed to echo with the rejected stone narrative. Talk about a romantic hangover.

Lunchtime came, and there I was, pondering life's twists over a plate. The rejected stone, now an unwelcome but persistent companion, nudged me to reassess my past choices. Was I chasing after glittery distractions while the true cornerstone patiently waited?

The afternoon sun cast long shadows, and as the day unfolded, so did my contemplation. It was like being in a real-life episode of a cosmic soap opera. Rejected stones, overlooked cornerstones – my love story was turning into a drama with unexpected plot twists.

Evening came and went, then the night sky unfolded above with a canvas of stars that seemed to wink knowingly. As I walked under the city lights, the rejected stone story became a silent companion, a reminder that love, like the universe, had its own grand design.

Back home, surrounded by the comfort of four walls, I got my smart phone and revisited the old photos and memories. The rejected stone had become a lens through which I viewed each moment. Ever leafed through old pictures and felt like you were watching scenes from a movie? That was my night.

As I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, the rejected stone mantra evolved into a lullaby of contemplation. The cornerstone I had overlooked was now the cornerstone of my thoughts. Little did I know, this mental marathon was just the warm-up for a love story that promised to be anything but ordinary. It was like the universe was telling me, "Buddy, this love story of yours is just getting started."

The next day dawned with a sense of anticipation. The rejected stone had become a guiding star, a cosmic North guiding me through the maze of emotions. I walked the same streets but everything felt different.

As the day unfolded, so did the layers of revelation. Each moment seemed pregnant with meaning, and every choice I made carried the weight of the rejected stone narrative. It was a bit like navigating a choose-your-own-adventure story, but with the added twist of cosmic intervention.

And there it was, the turning point. The revelation that life, much like love, was a series of choices – some overlooked, some rejected, and others destined to become cornerstones. Little did I know, as the days unfolded, this rejected stone revelation would shape the narrative in ways I hadn't imagined.

So, armed with this rejected stone revelation, I thought, why not bring Lillian front and center in my crazy life? Thoughts of Lillian became a constant ringtone in the background of my daily life. It was as if the universe, through the lens of the rejected stone metaphor, had handed me a roadmap to rewrite the script of my love story.

Determined to bring her closer, I embraced a new approach. I ditched the old playbook of missed connections and cranked up the friend vibes. Daily check-ins turned into regular chats and full-blown conversations. We went from casual chats to sharing everything from casual stories to the deep stuff. 

We went from "Hey, what's up?" to spilling our guts about everything. The rejection of the past was replaced by a conscious choice to make her an integral part of my present. It was like hitting the refresh button on an old friendship.

As our connection deepened, so did the layers of our friendship.  It was like discovering a hidden treasure in the clutter of choices I had made. Actually, it was more like rediscovering an old book with fresh eyes – each chapter unfolding with the anticipation of the unknown.

Chatting became a daily ritual, a cornerstone of our budding connection. We shared dreams, swapped stories, spilled secrets, and navigated the twists of life as a tag team. The rejected stone was doing a 180, becoming my secret weapon for a deeper connection. This ignored cornerstone, once a symbol of oversight, now transformed into a catalyst for transformation.

Our daily chats turned into lifelines. From early morning chats to late-night calls, we shared it all. The more we connected, the more I realized how much I had missed out on by chasing after the glittery distractions of the past. It was like the universe had pressed the reset button, giving me a chance to rewrite the love story I thought I had lost.

Our daily check-ins became a routine, but not the boring kind. It was more like a daily adventure where we explored each other's minds. And let me tell you, it was better than any scripted romance.

The more we chatted, the more I started seeing Lillian in a new light. She wasn't just my go-to person; she was becoming the missing piece that completed the puzzle of my life. The rejected stone, once a story of past missteps, now symbolized the resilience that led me to this extraordinary friendship.

Friendship turned into this beautiful dance of vulnerability. We shared not just the highlights but also the silly, real-life stuff. From heartaches to excitements, it was like discovering the unfiltered version of each other. We shared not just the polished versions of ourselves but also the messy, unfiltered realities. It was like unearthing the raw, unscripted beauty beneath the surface of each other's life.

Late-night conversations became our secret garden, where the rejected stone narrative transformed into whispered promises of something more. Every "Good night" wasn't just a farewell and every "Good morning" wasn't just a greeting; it was a promise to the discoveries that were about to unfold. Every shared laugh and every heartfelt conversation became the building blocks of something beautiful.

It was in those quiet moments, under the moonlight of our words, that I realised this wasn't just friendship; it was the unfolding of a love story that defied expectations. As we delved deeper into each other's worlds, we discovered that this wasn't just a tale of past missteps; it was the stepping stone that led me to the doorstep of an extraordinary connection. 

And then, just like the plot twist in a great novel, we seamlessly transitioned from friends to besties. Laughter continued to be the soundtrack of our connection, echoing in every message and call. It wasn't forced or planned; it just felt like the most natural thing in the world. Laughter, the glue of our friendship, became the anthem of our daily connection. So, as our connection deepened, I couldn't help but marvel at the beauty of rewriting the script.

In the midst of these conversations, something magical happened. The walls around my heart, constructed by a series of questionable decisions, started to crumble. Lillian, my unsung hero, emerged as the true star of my story and took the center stage as the real star of the show. The silent cornerstone emerged as the steadfast presence that had weathered the storms of my misguided pursuits. The ordinary started to feel extraordinary. A WhatsApp message or a phone call became a celebration of the genuine connection we were building.

The change from buddies to besties felt like the most natural thing in the world. Laughter became the anthem of our friendship, and in that easy flow, I stumbled upon a beautiful truth – rejected stones can metamorphose into the most solid cornerstones!

In the symphony of shared moments, it became clear that this wasn't just a rewrite of my story; it was a love story in the making. The rejected stone, with all its perfect imperfections, paved the way for something extraordinary.
