A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND INDEED
Lillian and I weren't just your run-of-the-mill pals; we were like two peas in a pod, always there for each other through thick and thin. Whenever life threw me a curveball, I knew I could count on her to have my back and offer a listening. Whether I needed a shoulder to cry on, a podium for my crazy ideas, or just someone to hangout with, Lillian was always available. 

Whenever Lillian needed some company, all she had to do was say the word, and I was there in a heartbeat. I had a fail-proof response: "Your wish is my command." It didn't matter if I had plans or commitments lined up for the day; if she wanted to chill, I was there in a heartbeat, and more than happy to drop everything and whisk her away for a fun-filled adventure. To me, it was just another outing with my bestie, but to the outside world, it seemed like something more – something akin to a date. They saw the way we laughed together, the easy way we fell into step with each other, and they couldn't help but wonder if there was something deeper going on.

But for Lillian and me, it was all just innocent fun – at least, that's what we told ourselves. We were so caught up in our friendship that we didn't stop to think about how others might perceive our interactions. To us, it was just another day spent in each other's company, enjoying each other's presence without any hidden agenda. To the people around us, they would whisper and nudge each other, exchanging knowing looks that said it all. But little did they know, we were just two pals having a good time, deaf to the romantic vibes they were picking up on.

People would see us out and about, laughing and chatting like old friends, or shared a meal at our favourite local restaurant, there was an undeniable chemistry between us that even onlookers couldn't ignore. I also couldn't help but notice the curious glances from passersby. They saw two people in sync, stealing glances when they thought no one was looking. 

People would often mistake us for a couple, and I couldn't blame them – the way we laughed together, finished each other's sentences, and just enjoyed each other's company was something special. It was as if they could see something brewing between us long before we even realised it ourselves. They saw the sparks of fireworks flying and the connection deepening with each passing day, even if we were still oblivious to the true nature of our feelings.

It was funny, really – here we were, just two friends enjoying each other's company, completely ignorant to the romantic vibes others seemed to be picking up on. As the saying goes, ignorance truly is bliss, and in our case, it allowed our bond to grow organically, free from the pressures and expectations that often accompany romantic relationships. 

We were so caught up in the moment, lost in our own little world, that we didn't even realise the effect we were having on those around us. We may have been just besties, but to the outside world, it was clear as day: there was something special brewing between us, something that transcended the boundaries of friendship and hinted at something more. 

It's funny how perception can sometimes be so far from reality. While others saw us as a potential couple in the making, we were content in our friendship, blissfully unaware of the romantic undercurrents swirling around us. But maybe, just maybe, they saw what we couldn't see ourselves and felt what we didn't feel yet. It was like they had a front-row seat to a love story that hadn't even begun to unfold. Who knows? After all, love has a funny way of sneaking up on you when you least expect it.

But looking back, I can't help but laugh at how clueless we were. While everyone else saw a potential romance blossoming, we were content just being the best of friends, blissfully unaware of the love that was right there in front of us, waiting to be discovered. Oh, the irony! The other people saw heart shaped sparks of fireworks flying where we saw nothing but friendship, and they whispered behind our backs about the possibility of something more blossoming between us. Little did they know, we were both equally clueless about the feelings stirring beneath the surface. But isn't that the beauty of friendship – the way it can blur the lines between friendship and romance without either party even realizing it?

Lillian and I were tighter than a pair of skinny jeans. She wasn't just my ride-or-die; she was my partner in crime, my wingwoman, and my go-to gal for everything from heart-to-heart chats to unplanned adventures. Whenever I needed a sounding board, she was there with bells on, ready to listen to my rants and raves without batting an eyelash.

Whether I was nursing a broken heart, grappling with loneliness, or simply craving some good company, Lillian was always just a phone call away, ready to brighten my day with her infectious laughter and warm presence. What made our friendship so special was the way we could talk about anything and everything under the sun without fear of judgment or ridicule. There was an effortless ease to our conversations, as if we were two halves of the same whole, perfectly attuned to each other's thoughts and feelings. In Lillian, I found not just a friend, but a kindred spirit – someone who understood me in a way that no one else ever could. And for that, I will be forever grateful.

What set Lillian apart from the rest was her uncanny ability to make even the most mundane moments feel like magic. We had this miraculous ability to finish each other's sentences and know what the other was thinking before they even said it out loud. Lillian could read me like a book, finishing my sentences before I even had a chance to utter them. We had our own style, our own rhythm, and our own brand of crazy that no one else could duplicate. It was like we had our own secret language that only we could understand. 

As the years rolled by, our bond only grew stronger. We shared countless inside jokes, made endless memories, and created our own little world where it was just the two of us against the world. We laughed together, grieved together, and everything in between. Lillian wasn't just a friend; she was family – the sister I never had and the confidante I always needed.

Looking back, I can't help but smile at all the adventures we've had together. From late-evening meet-ups to casual walks, there was never a dull moment when Lillian was around. She brought out the best in me and showed me what true friendship really means – that it's not just about being there for someone in their time of need, but also about standing by them through ups and downs, supporting them in their journey of self-discovery and growth.

So here's to Lillian – my partner-in-crime, my rock, and my forever Bestie. Thank you for being you and for always having my back, even when the going gets tough. And no matter where life takes us, I know that our relationship will always be the anchor that keeps us grounded in a sea of uncertainty. Cheers to all besties out there who unwittingly steal the show, one hangout at a time!
