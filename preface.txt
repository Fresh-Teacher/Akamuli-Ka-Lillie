PREFACE
Welcome to the world of "Love at Last Sight" – a realm where hearts dance to a different beat, and love unfolds in unexpected ways. Before you get lost in the pages of this book, let me take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for choosing to join me on this romantic adventure. You could be doing a million other things right now, but you've chosen to share this adventure with me, and for that, I'm truly grateful.

In a world where love stories are often packaged as fairy tales with love-at-first-sight magic, "Love at Last Sight" challenges that notion. We've all been spoon-fed the idea that love happens in an instant, a lightning strike that leaves us breathless. Movies and TV shows make it seem like finding "The Chosen One" is as easy as ordering a pizza on Jumia. But the real deal, my friend, is a whole different 
story. I am here to preach a totally different gospel about love. Well, you may call 
it "The Gospel of Love According to Jesse."

In these pages, you won't find love at first sight. Instead, you'll witness the magic of a gradual connection, a story that unfolds step by step. Love is messy, complicated, and beautifully imperfect. It's about the journey, not just the destination. As you delve into the lives of the characters in this book, remember that they're just human like you —flawed, hopeful, and searching for something real. I've poured my heart into crafting this tale, and I hope it resonates with the romantic dreamer in you.

A huge shoutout to all the hopeless romantics, the believers in second chances, and those who understand that love is a marathon, not a sprint. This one's for you. As you flip through these pages, you'll meet characters who are imperfect, genuine, and merely human, navigating the complexities of love in their own unique ways.

So, get a comfortable seat, perhaps with a cup of your favourite drink, and let's go on this adventure together. I assure you; if you start reading this book, you won't wish to put it down. I hope this book brings a sprinkle of joy and maybe even a few "aha" moments. Get ready to chuckle and witness firsthand how a relationship blossoms into something truly magical—one shared experience at a time. Let the adventure begin!
