PROLOGUE
I understand that for many, the word "Bible" holds deep religious significance, and I want to assure you that the intention behind calling this collection the "The Love Bible" is in no way meant to belittle or mock the Holy Scriptures.

The term "Bible" has its roots in the Greek word "biblia," which simply means "books." It's often used to describe any collection or anthology of writings, not just religious texts. In this context, "Love at Last Sight" is referred to as the "Love Bible" because it's a compilation of various love stories and experiences.

For example, in the chapter titled "Genesis," we explore the beginnings of our friendship, tracing back to the moment when Lillian and I first crossed paths and embarked on our journey together. It's a nostalgic look at the origins of our bond and how it all began.

As we move through the chapters, we encounter "Exodus," which signifies departure. This section delves into the bittersweet moments when Lillian left the Fresh Family, marking a significant transition in our relationship and leaving behind a sense of longing and nostalgia.

As we flip through the pages of "Chronicles," the pages come alive with tales of awkward moment as we navigated the delicate balance between friendship and budding romance. From late-night conversations to spontaneous outings, each memory is etched into the fabric of our story, adding depth and colour to our bond.

Then there's "Lamentations," a chapter that captures the sorrow and heartache I experienced when I attempted to pursue other romantic interests besides Lillian. It's a candid exploration of the challenges and pitfalls of love, highlighting the struggles and setbacks we encountered along the way.

Finally, we arrive at "Revelation!" This chapter symbolises exposure and serves as a revelation of sorts, as Lillian emerges as the cornerstone in my love life. It's a powerful testament to the profound impact she has had on my heart.

I hope this clarification puts any concerns to rest and allows us to fully appreciate the heartfelt stories contained within the pages of "Love at Last Sight." Just as the Holy Scriptures offer guidance and insight, may our story serve as a source of inspiration and reflection for all those who journey through its pages.
