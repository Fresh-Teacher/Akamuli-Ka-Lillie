BESTIE WA ME
As I told you at the beginning of this book, everything you’ve been taught about relationships is totally wrong! The TV shows make it look easy. For sure, movies have it down to a science. Two people connect—love at first sight—and the relationship is magical from then on. But come on, let's be real. Truth is, strong, deep relationships that last a lifetime aren’t based on the mysterious chemistry of two personalities. Real love in relationships—friends, married couples, siblings, parents—isn’t a magic act. It’s a journey. A great relationship grows from an investment of time and effort.

And hey, did I mention the fun fact? Lillian and I know something most people overlook! The most profound connections aren't sparked by a single glance. Instead, they're stitched together through the threads of shared experiences, the laughter echoing from last week's conversation, and the comforting words spoken in times of vulnerability. Actually, our relationship isn't your typical love story; it's a mosaic of genuine experiences, a love story which unfolds one adventure at a time.

Lillian and I have cracked the code to lasting connections, and it's not about fireworks at first sight. It's about the slow burn, the shared adventures, and the undeniable chemistry that reacts beneath the surface. Picture this journey as an adventure through the highs and lows of genuine connection. As we navigate from strangers to friends, from misunderstandings to inside jokes, and finally from besties to lovers, you'll discover that the most extraordinary connections don't follow a script. They're messy, they're real, and they're as unique as a fingerprint.

Forget the illusion of love at first sight. In the real world, love is a gradual process, crafted from the mosaic of moments that define a relationship. It's the journey from strangers to friends, from misunderstandings to understanding, and from besties to lovers. This is not just a journey—it's an invitation to witness the magic that happens when two souls connect and create a love story that's unique like ours.

Alright, let me spill the beans on the wild ride of Lillian and I. As I told you in the early chapters of this book, it all started in Buwambo – Lillian was just a stranger, a blip on my radar. Fast forward a bit, she joins the Fresh Family, and boom, we're friends!

As time waltzed on, Lillian became not just a stranger but a friend, weaving her way into the fabric of my life when she joined the Fresh Family. We laughed, shared stories, and became comrades in this crew. However, every story has its twists, and ours was no exception.

Now, here's where it gets juicy. The Fresh Family, once a paradise of shared moments, takes a dark turn. Hatred and envy creeps in and Lillian gets the boot. After being kicked out of the Fresh Family, it seems like the end, the closing chapter of a friendship that had weathered both sunshine and storm.

And guess what? Hold your breath, because our story took an unexpected turn! Lillian, not bothered by the storms of misunderstanding, extended an olive branch in the form of a birthday invitation. I hesitated, unsure of what to expect, but curiosity won, and I stepped into her world once more.

As the celebration unfolded, it became clear that this wasn't just a birthday party; it was a rekindling of a connection that had weathered its fair share of storms. The Fresh Family had it wrong, and Lillian's genuine heart shone through, brighter than ever.

Plot twist time! I decide to cut ties with the Fresh Family drama and focus on the real VVIP – Lillian. Our friendship, once on shaky ground, comes back stronger than ever. We're not just friends; we're Besties, with a capital B!

Now, if you're thinking this is the part where everything settles into a relaxed rhythm, well, think again. Our friendship wasn't just a casual label; it became a shared language of understanding, a safety net in the chaos of life. Lillian was more than a friend; she was the person who knew the unfiltered version of me, weaknesses and all. Together, we faced challenges, celebrated victories, and found solace in the simplicity of being there for each other. We laughed till our stomachs hurt, navigated through life's plot twists and discovered the true beauty of having a ride-or-die companion.

As our friendship deepened, we found ourselves not just navigating life's twists and turns but creating a masterpiece of shared adventures. From long road trips to quiet nights filled with deep conversations, Lillian and I discovered that being Besties wasn't just a title; it was a front-row seat to each other's growth. We became the architects of our own story, building bridges of trust and support that withstood the test of time.

But hold on, because the Besties adventure is more than just highs—it's about navigating the lows with grace. Lillian became my sounding board, my partner in crime fun, and the compass that guided me through the messiness of life. We faced challenges head-on, knowing that no storm could shake the foundation of our genuine connection.

Now, here's where it gets interesting. Despite the close bond with Lillian, the lovey-dovey vibes hadn't hit me yet. In fact, Lillian had her main man, Charles, in the picture. And you know what? I was cool with it. Yap, I knew him very well, and honestly, I wished nothing but the best for them. No secret yearnings or hidden agendas—just genuine friendship vibes. Lillian also knew that I had a girlfriend named Patrinah and she was totally fine with it.

Valentine's Day? Oh, that was a whole production. Picture this: Charles and I, conspiring like secret agents to plan the perfect surprise for Lillian. Little did I know that while we were planning the perfect Valentine's surprise, fate had a plot twist of its own brewing.

If only I had a crystal ball to see that Charles was enjoying himself with my future wife Lillian, he might not have survived a slap. I'm talking about a full-blown fight – probably ending with a swollen eye and a loose tooth due to punches. But hey, he must thank God who hid the future from us. If only the universe had dropped a hint or two, the poor guy might have left our Valentine's meeting with more than just valentine gift ideas— probably, most probably, a bleeding nose or a sore lip might have been in the conclusion. 

As the days unfolded, Charles and I continued our friendly alliance, innocently unaware that the plot of our lives was taking an unexpected turn. I genuinely wished them happiness, not realising that beneath the surface, a different kind of story was writing itself. So, as we ventured further into the realm of Besties, the script of love was quietly being edited, and the stage was set for a storyline that none of us could have predicted. 

As the curtain of time unfurled, Lillian remained Charles' leading lady, and I, the unsuspecting best friend, had no inkling that I would one day step into the role of her romantic counterpart. There I was, blissfully unaware, playing the perfect friend, little did I know that destiny had written its own script, that not even the best storytellers could have predicted. 

But hey, life's twists and turns are often more entertaining than any fiction. So, here's to the unexpected, the unplanned, and the surprising turns of fate. Life, it seems, enjoys playing its hand, turning tables around in ways we least expect it. The curtain was rising on a tale where destiny had the last laugh, and I was about to discover that sometimes, love scripts its own surprises.

As days turned into weeks and weeks into months, the unseen hand of fate was quietly orchestrating a change in the narrative. The twists and turns of life were preparing to reveal a love story that would catch us all off guard.

Let's dive into this real-life drama, folks! So, there I was, oblivious to the fact that Lillian was this hidden gem, a cornerstone I had casually ignored. She was right there, with Charles, like a precious stone handed to a builder who, much like me, failed to grasp its true value. 

Imagine, it's like entrusting a rare diamond to someone who doesn't quite realise they're holding a treasure. Charles had this incredible girl by his side, and at the time, neither of us truly understood the depth of what we had. It's a bit like giving a masterpiece painting to someone who thinks it's just a nice wall decoration.

Lillian, my unsuspecting cornerstone, was there all along, right in front of me, but I didn't fully grasp her value. What I was doing was like handing a cornerstone to another builder—Charles, in this scenario—who, like me, didn't quite realize the treasure he had in his hands. 

There they were, going about their love story, happily unaware of the silent protagonist at the sidelines—(that's me, by the way). It's almost as if I handed over this valuable cornerstone to someone else, thinking they'd build something beautiful with it. Charles, like me, held this gem without realising its worth, and there it was, waiting for someone to recognise its true brilliance.

Thankfully, somewhere along the way, a lightbulb moment hit me and I eventually wised up. I woke up to the realisation that this cornerstone, this extraordinary connection with Lillian, was something I couldn't afford to overlook. It was a chance worth seizing, a gem worth cherishing.

In the grand blueprint of fate, I eventually opened my eyes to the treasure that Lillian truly was. It's like realising the gem had been in plain sight all along, waiting for me to claim it as my own. So, I decided to reclaim that cornerstone from Charles, recognising its true value and making it my most treasured possession—a diamond in the rough that I now hold close to my heart.

As time passed, I came to understand that Lillian wasn't just a casual presence in the narrative of my life; she was the cornerstone, the foundation on which a love story would be built. Seeing her with Charles was like watching someone else hold this precious gem, not realising its potential, and not utilising the chance they had.

In a moment of revelation, it dawned on me that I had been handing over the most precious part of my story to someone who didn't fully understand its worth. In the grand scheme of things, I'm grateful for the moment of clarity when I recognized the true worth of that cornerstone. In love, we sometimes overlook the most significant elements until the universe gently nudges us to pay attention. It's as if the universe tapped me on the shoulder, saying, "Hey, the gem you've been overlooking is actually the one you've been searching for all along."

So, like a determined builder who finally recognises the true potential of that cornerstone, I decided to claim what was rightfully mine. I snatched it from the hands of fate and Charles, turning it into my treasured possession. Sometimes, we don't see the value of what we have until it's almost slipping through our fingers. But hey, better late than never, right? A cornerstone worth more than any jewel—a love story waiting to be built, one brick at a time.  From that point forward, Lillian became my treasured possession, a radiant gem in the mosaic of my life.

In love's blueprint, sometimes we need a second look to see the real value of what's right in front of us. Lillian, my cornerstone, my diamond in the rough, is now a shining jewel in the crown of our shared journey. 

So, armed with newfound clarity and a deep appreciation for the gem I had in Lillian, I embarked on a journey to reclaim what had always been meant for me. It was as if the universe had whispered, "The cornerstone you've been searching for is right in front of you."

In the grand construction of love, I considered Charles not as a rival but as a fellow builder who, like me, had briefly held this precious treasure without fully understanding its brilliance. With respect and understanding, I wanted him to step aside since I was ready to take my place as the rightful owner of this cornerstone. He had to step aside, understanding that the gem he held briefly had found its true home.

No longer hidden in plain sight, Lillian became the radiant centre, the jewel that illuminated the pages of our shared tale. In the grand theater of life, the unexpected twists and turns had led me to the realisation that sometimes, what we're searching for is right in front of us.
