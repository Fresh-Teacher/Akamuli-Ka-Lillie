PARTNERS IN CRIME 
Buckle up folks, 'cause this is the tale of the day 
Lillian strutted onto the scene at Victoria 
University and turned my buddies' world upside 
down. It all started when yours truly, Jesse, the 
self-proclaimed ambassador of the Single Men 
Association at University (SMAU), suddenly 
announces he's got a girl friend. I repeat, a girl 
friend, not a girl lover. 
 
It was a typical day at Victoria University, where 
the air is filled with the scent of ambition and last
minute cramming. Now, add a sprinkle of drama, a 
dash of disbelief, and a whole lot of hilarity, and 
you've got yourself the perfect recipe for what 
went down on the first day Lillian graced our campus 
with her presence. 
 
Now, let me set the stage for you. Yours truly, the 
self-proclaimed ambassador of the single life, had 
been proudly flying the flag for bachelorhood for as 
long as I could remember. My friends, bless their 
skeptical souls, never missed an opportunity to tease

me about my single life. So, when I dropped the 
bombshell to my buddies that I had snagged myself 
a girlfriend named Lillian, they nearly fell off their 
chairs laughing. You can bet your last cent they 
didn't buy it for a second. 
 
They practically rolled on the floor laughing, 
thinking I'd lost my marbles. But I, being me, I 
wasn't about to let their doubts rain on my parade. 
Oh no, I promised to bring Lillian to campus one day, 
and bro, I was really determined. 
 
Naturally, my friends weren't buying it. Anyways, 
who could blame them? I was the guy who couldn't 
commit to a pizza topping, let alone a relationship! 
But I was determined to prove them wrong. Oh boy, 
was I determined! When I promised my pals that I'd 
bring her to campus, they were all like, "Yeah, sure, 
Jesse. We'll believe it when pigs fly."  
 
Fast forward to the D-day. Lillian, being the good 
sport she is, agreed to accompany me to the land of 
academia. So, there we were, Lillian and I, strutting 
onto campus like we owned the place. My friends had 
Page | 245  
 
no idea what was about to hit them. My buddies' 
jaws almost hit the floor as if they'd just witnessed 
a magic trick. 
 
We sauntered into the lecture hall, hand in hand, 
like we were strutting down a red carpet and let me 
tell you, the lecturer might as well have been 
teaching computer programming to a room full of 
penguins because nobody was paying attention. "This 
can't be happening!" they seemed to mutter, 
looking like they'd seen a ghost. 
 
The lecturer's voice trailed off into oblivion as all 
eyes lock onto us, mouths agape in disbelief. All eyes 
were on us, and I could practically feel the disbelief 
radiating from my friends. You could practically hear 
the collective gasp echoing through the room as my 
pals realized that, yup, their buddy Jesse had 
indeed managed to snag himself a girlfriend. 
 
I could almost hear their inner monologues: "Is that 
Jesse? With a girlfriend? No way! It's not him, 
he just looks like him!" Oh, how sweet it was to 
Page | 246  
 
watch their skepticism crumble before their very 
eyes. 
 
It was like they'd seen a unicorn riding a unicycle. 
"Jesse, is that really you?" they seemed to ask 
with their curious looks, their jaws practically 
sweeping the floor. Some of them even looked like 
they were questioning the fabric of reality itself. I 
could actually feel the skepticism emanating from 
them. Their eyes bore into us, their silent scrutiny 
almost palpable. 
 
The looks on their faces were priceless – part shock, 
part disbelief, and I shot them proud wink 
practically meaning "I told you so" written in 
invisible ink. I couldn't help but bask in the glory of 
the moment as we took our seats, Lillian and I, 
amidst the uproar of whispers and raised eyebrows. 
 
But there we were, living proof that miracles do 
happen. And there you have it, folks – the day Jesse 
turned the tables on his skeptical friends and 
proved that even the most die-hard bachelors 
aren't immune to a little thing called love. As for

Lillian and me? Well, let's just say we were the talk 
of the campus for weeks to come.  
 
And let me tell you, introducing Lillian to the campus 
was definitely a home run in the game of surprises. 
Who knew being a "Committed Bachelor" could be so 
entertaining? 
 
Ah, the infamous moment of truth. There we were, 
boldly striding into the lion's den – aka, the 
university lecture room. It was a risky move, no 
doubt about it, but I was determined to prove my 
buddies wrong and show them that Lillian could 
blend in seamlessly, even in the most academic of 
settings. 
 
Now, you have to understand, Lillian wasn't exactly a 
card-carrying member of our esteemed institution, 
which made sneaking her into one of our lectures a 
risky endeavor. In fact, she wasn't a student at all. 
But hey, what's life without a little risk? Actually, 
rules were made to be bent, right? 
 
Page | 248  
 
 And I was determined to prove my buddies wrong, 
even if it meant risking a run-in with the powers 
that be. But hey, when have I ever shied away from 
a little risk? It was a gamble, to be sure, but one I 
was willing to take to prove my buddies wrong. 
 
As we tiptoed into the lecture hall, I couldn't shake 
the feeling of impending doom looming over us like a 
dark cloud. Would we be caught red-handed? Would 
our carefully constructed plan come crashing down 
around us? Only time would tell. 
 
The lecturer, the gatekeeper of knowledge, shot us 
a dubious glance, sizing up the situation with a 
critical eye. I couldn't help but feel a twinge of 
apprehension. Would he raise an eyebrow at Lillian's 
presence? Would he grill her with questions, 
exposing our little charade? The suspense was killing 
me. 
 
And then it happened. The lecturer's gaze fell upon 
us, and for a split second, I swear time stood still. 
Would he demand an explanation for Lillian's 
presence in a room full of students she had no 
Page | 249  
 
business being in? I held my breath, silently praying 
that he wouldn't zero in on Lillian and blow our 
cover. Those ten seconds he stared at us felt like an 
eternity, each moment stretching out into infinity as 
we held our collective breath. 
 
My heart skipped a beat, and time seemed to grind 
to a halt as we braced ourselves for the inevitable 
interrogation. Time seemed to stand still as we 
waited for his reaction, every second stretching into 
an eternity of uncertainty. Would he call her out? 
Would he demand an explanation for her presence? 
My heart pounded in my chest as I silently pleaded 
with the universe to spare us from any unwanted 
attention. 
 
Then, just when I thought all hope was lost, the man 
just carried on with his lecture, as if nothing out of 
the ordinary had occurred. It was a miracle! 
Whether he mistook Lillian for a new student or 
maybe he simply couldn't be bothered to disrupt the 
flow of his lecture for a couple of unruly students. 
Who knows? One thing's for sure – I owe that 
Page | 250  
 
lecturer a debt of gratitude for turning a blind eye 
to our little nonsense. 
 
In that moment, I couldn't help but feel a surge of 
gratitude towards our professor. As the tension 
eased and we settled into our seats, a wave of relief 
washed over me. We had dodged a bullet, my 
friends.  
 
Or maybe, just maybe, he was once a young rebel 
himself, familiar with the antics of the youth. Or 
perhaps he simply decided that life was too short to 
sweat the small stuff. After all, who knows better 
than a former youth the wild antics and capers that 
ensue in the world of academia? 
 
Whatever the case may be, one thing was for sure: 
we had dodged a bullet, and I couldn't help but 
chuckle at the absurdity of it all. Ah, the joys of 
youth, where every day is an adventure. As they say, 
fortune favours the bold – and in that moment, I 
was feeling pretty darn bold indeed.

When the lecture ended, we hurried to catch the 
lift and leave campus. So there we were, Lillian and 
I, just trying to catch a lift down to the first floor, 
when who should come in but our very own lecturer, 
Prof. Stoneface. Talk about a coincedence, right?  
 
There we were, Lillian, the lecturer, and yours truly, 
all crammed into this tiny square metal coffin 
heading towards the first floor of the University 
Building. And let me tell you, the atmosphere in that 
lift was so thick that you could practically cut it 
with a knife.  
 
My palms were itching, and bullets of sweat were 
popping up on my forehead like mushrooms after a 
rainstorm. I could practically hear my heartbeat 
drumming a frantic rhythm against my ribcage. 
 
Now, I had planned for many things that day – a 
surprise entrance with Lillian, a grand welcome from 
my fellow coursemates – but playing dodgeball with 
the lecturer wasn't on the agenda. Yet here we 
were, hurtling towards potential disaster at ten 
floors per second.

Now, I have to admit, panic started to set in faster 
than an employee running to catch the bus. The 
thought of being caught red-handed smuggling a 
non-student into class was enough to turn my 
stomach into a garden full of butterflies. I could 
practically feel the walls closing in on me as beads 
of sweat began their own break dance on my 
forehead. 
 
I was caught between a rock and a hard place. On 
one hand, I was petrified of getting caught red
handed smuggling a non-student into class—a 
criminal offense in the eyes of academia. On the 
other hand, I was desperately trying to play it cool, 
hoping against hope that our lecturer wouldn't 
recognise Lillian or start bombarding me with 
questions. 
 
The silence in that lift was deafening, broken only 
by the rhythmic hum of the descending elevator. I 
braced myself for the inevitable barrage of 
questions, each one a potential nail in the coffin of 
my carefully constructed trouble.

I mustered up the courage for a polite greeting, but 
it was like trying to start a car with an empty tank. 
Summoning every ounce of courage I had left, I 
cleared my throat and managed a feeble "Good 
afternoon, sir," I croaked out, my voice trembling 
with a mixture of fear and desperation. But alas, the 
lecturer remained as silent as a stone, as if the 
universe itself had hit the mute button on our 
conversation. 
 
Mr. Stoneface remained, well, stony-faced. Was he 
ignoring me, or had my voice been drowned out by 
the deafening thud of my own heartbeat? I had 
tried to break the ice but it was like trying to start 
a mingle posho with a toothpick – no response. Either 
he was deep in thought or he'd finally perfected the 
art of selective hearing. 
 
Lillian shot me a sideways glance, probably 
wondering why her bestie was suddenly sweating like 
a marathon runner in a sauna.

The air grew thicker with every passing floor, each 
ding of the elevator feeling like a countdown to my 
inevitable demise. I dared not breathe, for fear 
that even the slightest exhale might trigger an 
interrogation from our silent companion. I mean, 
let's face it, smuggling a non-student into a lecture 
hall is pretty much a one-way ticket to the 
principal's office, and I wasn't exactly eager to 
book that trip. 
 
So, as we descended floor by floor, my heart 
pounded like a jackhammer in my chest. I stole a 
glance at the floor numbers ticking down on the 
screen display in the lift, silently willing them to 
move faster to deliver me from this impending doom. 
 
Finally, blessed relief! The lift reached the first 
floor, and the doors slid open like the gates of 
salvation. Without a second thought, I bolted out of 
there like a sinner out of hell, eager to put as much 
distance between myself and the potential disaster 
lurking within those four walls of the metallic 
casket.  
 
Page | 255  
 
No looking back, no regrets – just a narrow escape 
and a newfound appreciation for the simple joy of 
solid ground beneath my feet. As I emerged into the 
relative safety of the first floor, I couldn't help 
but exhale a breath of relief I hadn't realised I'd 
been holding.  
 
The ordeal was over, at least for now. Dodged a 
bullet there, didn't I? But hey, at least Lillian didn't 
seem to notice my near meltdown. I tried to stay 
cool so that she doesn't think I am a coward. Hope 
she is not reading this… 
 
As I sprinted down the hallway with Lillian, 
adrenaline coursing through my veins, I couldn't help 
but marvel at the absurdity of the situation. Who 
knew a simple elevator ride could turn into a high
stakes game of cat and mouse? 
 
Lesson Learned: never, ever, not even once, 
share an elevator with your lecturer again. And 
as for smuggling non-students into lectures? 
Let's just say I'll leave that to the professionals 
from now on.

Needless to say, next time, I'll take the stairs – at 
least there, the only thing waiting for me is a good 
old-fashioned workout! And as for Lillian? Well, let's 
just say she definitely added a whole new level of 
excitement to my university experience. Ah, young 
love – isn't it exciting?
