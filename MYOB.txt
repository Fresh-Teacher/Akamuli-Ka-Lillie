MYOB
As we prepared to depart the following day, the atmosphere was filled with a bittersweet blend of gratitude and reluctance. Lillian, who had initially planned for a quick visit, found herself torn between the comfort of our family's embrace and the obligations awaiting her back in Kampala.

Despite her initial hesitations, Lillian had come to cherish the time spent with my family, relishing in the warmth of their hospitality and the genuine affection they had shown her. It was a far cry from the intimidating image she had conjured up in her mind about meeting my parents.

As we said our goodbyes and made our way back to Kampala, Lillian couldn't shake the feeling of warmth and acceptance that lingered in her heart. She knew that she had found a second home in my family's embrace, a place where she was welcomed with open arms and genuine love.

Amidst the hustle and bustle of returning back to Kampala together, Bob's unexpected offer to escort us back to Kampala caught us by surprise! It was a gesture of friendship that warmed our hearts and added an unexpected twist to our departure from Masaka.

As we waited for a taxi to whisk us away, Lillian and I slipped away from Bob's watchful eye to steal a few final moments together in Masaka. With Bob busy flagging down passing vehicles, we slipped away unnoticed, eager to capture the essence of our time in Masaka in a series of selfies and sweet kisses.

With each snap of the camera, the warmth of our connection radiated through the lens as we immortalised the memories we had shared in Masaka, capturing the essence of our bond in every frame. It was a bittersweet reminder of the bonds we had forged and the adventures we had embarked on together.

Bob tried to stop the passing cars but all in vain. It seems like nature had intentionally caused the delay in order for us to spend more quality time with each other. As Bob's efforts finally paid off and a taxi pulled up to the sidewalk, we reluctantly tore ourselves away from our lovey-dovey photoshoot, knowing that the time had come to bid farewell to Masaka.

As we rejoined Bob and prepared to embark on the journey back to Kampala, our hearts were filled with gratitude for the experiences we had shared and the friendships that had enriched our lives. And as we waved goodbye to Masaka, we carried with us the cherished memories of our time spent in its embrace.

Bob, the master of love schemes, pulled off a genius move by securing seats strategically positioned for Lillian and I. With a twinkle in his eye and a grin that screamed "I've got this," he strategically positioned us in the van like pieces on a chessboard. He plopped himself a couple of seats away from us, leaving himself conveniently at arm's length. He pretended to be focusing on his button phone, probably playing Doodle Jump or plotting his next matchmaking adventure.

Bob's strategic seating arrangement in the van was like something out of a romantic comedy. There he was, pretending to be engrossed in his phone games, while secretly playing cupid for Lillian and me. It was like he had taken on the role of our love guru, ensuring we had the perfect setup for some hand-holding and whispered sweet nothings.

Meanwhile, as Bob played his part to perfection, Lillian and I couldn't resist stealing glances and exchanging whispered conversations like a pair of school kids secretly passing cheats in an examination room. With Bob's subtle intervention, Lillian and I found ourselves stealing glances and sharing whispered conversations without a care in the world. It was like we were in our own little bubble of romance, oblivious to the chaos of the outside world. 

As the van chugged along the road, Bob masterfully played the role of the oblivious third wheel, burying himself in a game on his phone while giving us the illusion of privacy. I couldn't decide if he was a genius or just a mischief-maker with impeccable timing. Bob played his part to perfection, pretending to be engrossed in his game while keeping a watchful eye on our budding romance. I had to hand it to him; he had the whole charade down to an art.

As we continued on our journey back to the city, Bob's antics provided a hilarious backdrop to our budding romance. With each passing mile, I couldn't help but admire his dedication to our cause, even if it meant sacrificing his personal space for the sake of our love story. His willingness to go to such lengths to ensure our happiness was a testament to the strength of our bond and the power of true friendship.

Here we were, three friends on a journey filled with laughter, love, and just a hint of mischief. It was moments like these that made life truly unforgettable. With every passing mile, I couldn't help but appreciate Bob's friendship and the hilariously unexpected turn of events that had brought Lillian and me closer together. In that moment, amidst the rumble of the van and the faint strains of Bob's exaggerated phone gaming, I realized that true love often unfolds in the most absurd and delightful ways.

Wrapped in each other's arms, Lillian nestled her head on my shoulder, and the world around us seemed to fade away. Despite the cramped quarters of the vehicle, our conversation flowed effortlessly, as if we were the only two people in the world. As we chatted and laughed, our connection deepened with each passing moment. It was as if the journey itself had become a metaphor for our budding relationship, with each mile bringing us closer together and solidifying the bond between us.

As we basked in the warmth of each other's company, I couldn't help but notice the curious glances from our fellow passengers. Their eyes lingered on us, silently observing the tender display of affection between two youthful lovers. It was as if they were trying to decipher the nature of our relationship, their eyes lingering a moment too long on our intertwined fingers and whispered endearments.

Despite the sideways glances and raised eyebrows from some of our fellow travelers, we remained unfazed, secure in the knowledge that our love was genuine and worth celebrating, even in the most unexpected of places. In that moment, it was just Lillian and me against the world, our bond unbreakable and our love undeniable. After all, when you're in love, the only opinions that matter are those of the ones you hold closest to your heart.

With each passing mile, the outside world seemed to blur into insignificance, leaving only the two of us wrapped up in our own little bubble of love. It was a reminder that in matters of the heart, the power of love can transcend boundaries and defy expectations, even in the most mundane of settings.

In every moment, it became increasingly clear that our connection was something special, something worth cherishing and nurturing. And as we journeyed towards our destination, hand in hand and heart to heart, we knew that our love would only continue to grow stronger with each passing day.

So, as we journeyed back to the city, cocooned in each other's arms, we embraced the freedom to love openly and unabashedly, unencumbered by the judgement of those around us. For in that moment, all that mattered was the love we shared and the promise of a future filled with endless possibility.

So, to all the curious onlookers and nosy bystanders, we had just one message: MYOB (Mind Your Own Business), because when it comes to matters of the heart, sometimes it's best to simply mind your own business and let love take its course. After all, our love was our own, and we had no intention of letting anyone else dictate the terms of our romance.
