CANDLE ORB LIT DINNER 
Oh, the taxi ride back to Kampala after our Lugazi 
escapade! The hum of the engine, the occasional 
beep from the streets, and there we were, side by 
side, still basking in the afterglow of our day. As the 
taxi navigated its way through the roads, we 
couldn't help but replay the moments we shared in 
Lugazi. The town's enchanting aura lingered in our 
minds, and the memories were like postcards we 
couldn't wait to open and revisit. 
 
Sitting next to each other, it felt like the taxi had 
turned into a time machine, transporting us back to 
Lugazi's lively streets, the high school corridors, 
and the cozy café where our laughter echoed. 
There's something about the journey back home 
after creating beautiful memories – every bump on 
the road felt like a reminder of the delightful day 
we'd just shared. 
 
The taxi, with its rhythmic motion, became our 
chariot, carrying not just two passengers but a 
trove of shared experiences and budding emotions. 
The air inside held a mix of contentment and

anticipation, as if the universe itself was smiling 
upon the connection that had deepened during our 
little adventure. 
 
As we approached Kampala, the city lights welcomed 
us back, but the warmth of Lugazi still lingered. The 
taxi ride wasn't just a physical journey; it was a 
continuation of the emotional voyage we'd embarked 
upon in that quaint town. 
 
And so, with Lugazi's magic echoing in our hearts, 
we stepped out of the taxi, grateful for the shared 
stories, the laughter, and the unspoken promises 
that traveled with us. Home was just a destination 
on the map, but the journey of our hearts had found 
a new chapter in the pages of Lugazi's memory.  
 
Stepping out of the taxi, the memories of Lugazi 
clung to us like the warmth of a fading sunset. 
Kampala welcomed us with its bustling streets, but 
our hearts carried the serenity of a day spent 
exploring a town that had unexpectedly become the 
canvas of our budding love story.

As we navigated the familiar streets of Kampala, 
the echoes of Lugazi lingered in our conversations. 
Every corner, every shared glance, became a silent 
homage to the enchanting day we had just 
experienced. It's funny how a town, unbeknownst to 
itself, can leave an indelible mark on the chapters of 
our lives. 
 
Entering our familiar spaces, it felt like we were 
bringing a piece of Lugazi with us. The ordinary had 
been transformed into the extraordinary, and the 
city lights seemed to twinkle with a knowing wink as 
if acknowledging the secret we now shared. 
 
The journey didn't end with the closing of the taxi 
door; it continued in the shared smiles, the laughter, 
and the exchanged glances that spoke volumes. Our 
hearts, like intrepid explorers, had discovered 
something profound in the simplicity of a 
spontaneous adventure. 
 
After the taxi dropped us off in Kampala, we found 
ourselves drawn to a local restaurant—a cozy haven 
Page | 91  
 
that seemed perfect for continuing the joyous vibe 
of our day. 
 
Seated at a table, we decided to indulge in a 
comforting plate of chips and fried fish. The aroma 
of the sizzling delicacies filled the air, adding 
another layer of delight to our already contented 
hearts. The aroma of chips and fried fish wafted 
through the air, adding a savory note to our journey. 
As we savored the local flavours, the ordinary 
became extraordinary in the shared joy of a meal. 
It was one of those unplanned detours that felt just 
right. 
 
And then came the romantic moment—a small, 
wrapped package, a Valentine's Day surprise that I 
had been eagerly holding onto. The anticipation in 
the air was palpable as I presented the gift to 
Lillian. Her eyes sparkled with curiosity and 
excitement. 
 
What a magical Valentine's Day surprise! Picture us 
in that local restaurant, surrounded by the 
comforting aroma of chips and fried fish. I handed 
Page | 92  
 
Lillian this mysterious-looking thingy with liquid 
inside and a tiny switch underneath. The anticipation 
of unveiling the gift was met with enchantment as 
Lillian discovered the crystal ball—a radiant orb 
containing liquid that, when a hidden switch below it 
was pressed, illuminated the space with a 
mesmerizing array of colours. 
 
As she pressed the switch, the whole vibe changed. 
Suddenly, our table was bathed in this mesmerizing 
display of colourful lights. It was like our own mini 
fireworks show right there in the restaurant! 
Lillian's eyes lit up, and the joy on her face made 
that moment feel like a scene from a romance movie.  
 
As the room transformed into a kaleidoscope of 
hues, the radiant glow mirrored the joy that filled 
the air. It was more than a valentine gift; it was a 
symbol of the vibrant connection we shared, an 
embodiment of the unexpected magic that had 
woven itself into our day. 
 
The crystal ball, with its colourful dance of light, 
became a tangible representation of the intangible—
Page | 93  
 
love's ability to illuminate even the simplest 
moments. And there, in that local restaurant, 
surrounded by the glow of our shared laughter and 
the enchanting hues of the crystal ball, we found 
ourselves immersed in a celebration of the 
extraordinary within the ordinary. 
 
The joy that lit up her face when she examined the 
surprise valentine gift was priceless. It was a simple 
yet heartfelt gesture, and her appreciation turned 
that ordinary restaurant into a place of shared bliss 
and connection. The restaurant, once just a stop for 
a quick bite, became a stage for a spontaneous 
celebration of love. The magical orb, with its vibrant 
hues, added a touch of whimsy to our post-Lugazi 
rendezvous, creating a memory that transcended 
the ordinary. 
 
As the lights played across the table, they painted a 
silent tribute to the enchantment of Lugazi and the 
unfolding story of our connection. We found 
ourselves lost in a conversation that flowed 
effortlessly, much like the colourful lights that 
adorned our table. The restaurant became a spot 
Page | 94  
 
where laughter echoed, and time seemed to stretch 
to accommodate the magic of the moment. And 
there it was, this little magical orb – not your typical 
Valentine's gift, right?  
 
As we crashed the chips and fried fish, the 
atmosphere around us seemed to echo with the 
whispers of Lugazi's enchantment. Love, in its 
various forms, had become the invisible thread 
weaving through the fabric of our day—from 
spontaneous journeys to heartfelt surprises. In that 
quaint restaurant, under the spell of our little 
illuminated sphere, we discovered the beauty of 
finding joy in the now. 
 
And so, with bellies content and hearts full, our 
post-Lugazi adventure continued, marked not only by 
the taste of snacks but by the warmth of shared 
smiles and unexpected surprises. Here's to the 
ordinary moments that become extraordinary 
memories.  
 
We sat there, munching on chips, with this 
enchanted orb casting its glow over us. People 
Page | 95  
 
around us were probably wondering what kind of 
date night we were having! It wasn't just a gift; it 
was a playful reminder that love can surprise you in 
the most unexpected ways. 
 
So, with our magical orb stealing the show, we 
continued to savor the simple pleasures of that 
evening – the taste of fried fish, the glow of 
colourful lights, and the shared laughter that 
echoed in the air. Here's to the magic of love and 
the ordinary moments that become extraordinary 
memories. 
 
And there we were, basking in the glow of this 
enchanting orb like characters in our own romantic 
movie. The restaurant seemed to transform into our 
personal wonderland, with the colourful lights 
casting a magical spell over our little corner. As we 
enjoyed the chips and fried fish, the vibrant hues 
from the orb danced across the table, creating a 
whimsical atmosphere. It was like a silent 
celebration of our journey from Lugazi, with each 
flicker of light telling a story of unexpected 
adventures. 
Page | 96  
 
 
I couldn't help but marvel at how something as 
simple as a switch could bring so much joy. The 
mystical glow illuminated not just the restaurant but 
also the unspoken connection between us. It was a 
reminder that love doesn't always need big stuff; 
sometimes, it's the small, magical moments that 
leave the most lasting impressions. It isn't about 
the extravagant gifts; it is all about the shared 
moments, the laughter, and the enchantment that lit 
up the ordinary. 
 
So, there we sat, enjoying the ordinary yet 
extraordinary delights of a local restaurant, with 
our magical orb adding a touch of sparkle to our 
evening.  
As we continued to enjoy our meal, the magical orb 
became our own little beacon of joy. The restaurant 
buzzed with the chatter of other diners, but in our 
corner, it felt like time had slowed down, allowing us 
to digest the magic of love unfolding between us. 
 
At the press of the switch, the colours danced in a 
playful rhythm, reflecting the shared love and 
Page | 97  
 
unspoken understanding that had become the 
soundtrack of our connection. It was a scene 
straight out of a feel-good movie, and we were the 
protagonists of our own love story. 
 
People passing by couldn't help but steal glances at 
our table – a couple immersed in the glow of an 
enchanted orb. The ordinary became extraordinary, 
and our Valentine's Day celebration turned into a 
tale of whimsy and delight. 
 
So, here's to the magic of love found in unexpected 
places, to the simple gestures that turn an evening 
into a cherished memory, and to the colourful lights 
that illuminated our hearts that Valentine's Day. 
Cheers to the ordinary moments that become 
extraordinary chapters in our love story.  
 
As the evening wore on, we found ourselves 
reluctant to leave the cozy haven of the restaurant. 
The enchantment of the magical orb had woven a 
spell around us, creating an atmosphere where time 
seemed to stand still.  
 
Page | 98  
 
As we wrapped up our meal, the mystical glow of the 
orb became a metaphor for the warmth and 
connection we were building. Leaving the restaurant, 
we carried with us the glow of that enchanting 
evening—a glow that extended beyond the colorful 
lights of the orb. It illuminated the path of our 
journey, turning ordinary moments into cherished 
memories. 
 
Ah, the magic of midnight and the world that seems 
to pause for love! As we stepped out of the local 
restaurant into the late-night air, the city had 
settled into a quiet rhythm, creating a canvas for 
our own romantic cinema. Under the moonlit sky, our 
journey through the quiet streets became a dance 
of shadows and shared secrets. The city lights, 
though dimmed, cast a gentle glow on our path, 
creating a romantic ambiance that heightened the 
magic of the night. 
 
With the enchantment of the evening still lingering, 
we moved through the streets, our steps in harmony 
with the soft glow of the city lights. The passing 
minutes felt like stolen moments, and time seemed 
Page | 99  
 
to stretch to accommodate the magic of the night. 
The air was laced with the scent of adventure, and 
every step we took felt like a thrill, a secret we 
were sharing with the city that never sleeps. 
 
Holding each other close, we became a silhouette 
against the background of the sleeping city. 
Wrapped up in each other's presence, the world 
around us seemed to blur, leaving only the echo of 
our laughter and the soft whispers of the night 
breeze. Every step felt like a chapter turning in our 
story, written with the ink of shared moments and 
illuminated by the glow of newfound love. Admirers 
and passersby, perhaps lost in the charm of our 
connection, stole glances as we passed by, their 
curiosity adding an extra layer to the enchantment 
of the night. 
 
It was one of those moments where the world 
outside seemed to fade away, leaving just the two of 
us and the silent whispers of a city that had 
witnessed a love story unfold. Approaching midnight 
had never felt so liberating. Time, no longer a 
constraint, allowed us to feel the serenity of the 
Page | 100  
 
hour and the magic that unfolded in the quiet 
corners of the city. With each step, we etched our 
presence into the tapestry of the night, creating a 
memory that would linger long after the clock struck 
twelve. 
 
And so, hand in hand, beneath the midnight sky, we 
continued our journey through the streets—two 
souls wrapped in the embrace of love, accompanied 
by the symphony of the night. Midnight, usually a 
marker of endings, held no concerns for us; it was a 
companion in our journey, embracing the tale of an 
ordinary evening turned extraordinary. And let me 
tell you, the city, with its sleepy buildings and quiet 
corners, became our playground—a canvas for us to 
paint with the hues of laughter and secret feelings 
for each other. 
 
So, with the city as our silent witness and the magic 
of midnight as our guide, we continued our stroll, 
lost in the beauty of the night and the enchantment 
of newfound love. The city, draped in the stillness of 
midnight, became our playground. Our steps echoed 
through the quiet streets, and the occasional hush 
Page | 101  
 
of the night breeze added a soothing soundtrack to 
our shared adventure. 
 
With every passing moment, the connection between 
us deepened, and the streets we traversed became 
witnesses to a story unfolding in the shadowy 
embrace of midnight. The world had transformed 
into a canvas of possibilities, painted with the 
strokes of laughter and whispered promises. It was 
like being part of a secret society where the 
currency was laughter and the language was written 
in the sparkles of the night sky. 
 
As we moved through the night, the city lights 
overhead seemed to nod in approval, casting a gentle 
glow on our intertwined hands. The admiring glances 
from onlookers transformed into silent cheers, 
acknowledging the love emanating from Lillian and I. 
Under the moon's gentle gaze, we continued to 
explore the city's secrets—a duo bound by the 
magic of the night and the thrill of a love story 
written in the language of the stars. 
 
Page | 102  
 
Oh, the bittersweet dance with time, where each 
moment feels like a stolen treasure slipping through 
your fingers. As the inevitable goodbye approached, 
I couldn't help but wish for the impossible; I found 
myself yearning to press pause, to freeze the 
clock's relentless march. 
 
In the company of Lillian, time seemed to sprout 
wings, fluttering away with a swiftness that left me 
craving more. If only I could freeze time, I would 
have suspended it temporarily so that I delay our 
separation. The laughter we shared, the stolen 
glances, and the quiet whispers of the night were 
like fragments of a dream slipping into the waking 
world. 
 
Wishing for the power to freeze time, I yearned to 
stretch those final moments, to enjoy the closeness, 
and to linger in the embrace of the sweet romance. 
If only I could command time to stand still, granting 
us an eternity within the confines of that magical 
night.  
 
Page | 103  
 
As the seconds ticked away, I couldn't shake the 
desire to rewind, to relive the moments that 
unfolded like a cherished reel of memories. The 
streetlights, witnesses to our journey, seemed to 
flicker in agreement, as if acknowledging the 
universal longing to linger in the embrace of love. 
 
But time, relentless in its forward march, carried us 
closer to the moment of goodbye. The yearning to 
freeze and rewind remained unfulfilled. And so, with 
a heart heavy with the weight of goodbyes, I 
embraced the hope that time might circle back to 
moments like these—a wish whispered to the night 
sky as I bid farewell to Lillian. ⏳ 
 
Walking the solitary path home, the echoes of the 
day replayed in the quiet corners of my thoughts. 
The surprise lingered, casting a gentle glow on the 
ordinary streets that now seemed to hold the 
weight of our secret feelings towards each other. 
Thoughts swirled like shadows in the night, and as I 
tread the familiar path alone, the echoes of our 
shared Valentine's Day played in my mind. 
 
Page | 104  
 
What struck me most was the paradox we lived—a 
dance between friendship and an undeniable 
closeness that echoed something more. We 
navigated the day as best friends, yet the air 
carried the romantic notes of a love story waiting to 
unfold.  
 
Ever found yourself in a pondering session where 
you're left with more questions than answers? The 
question "Are we, or aren't we?" kept popping up 
in my mind. I mulled over the day's events, 
wondering if the chemistry between us was just a 
product of our close friendship or if there was an 
unspoken truth waiting to surface. The question 
lingered in my thoughts and I couldn't let go of it. 
It was like trying to decipher a complex puzzle – the 
more you think about it, the more questions arise. 
It's more like trying to read between the lines of a 
story that hasn't been fully written. 
 
Ever found yourself walking home alone, replaying 
the day's events in your mind like a movie on repeat? 
That was me, lost in thoughts, each step a beat in 
the rhythm of contemplation. Valentine's Day, the 
Page | 105  
 
lovers' extravaganza, turned into this unexpected 
chapter in the book of friendship with Lillian. We 
were just besties, yet the air around us buzzed with 
an energy that left me questioning the boundaries 
of our connection. Laughter, shared glances, a 
heartfelt valentine gift—ingredients of a day that 
screamed something more! 
 
Valentine's Day, typically reserved for lovers, was 
spent in the guise of mere besties, yet every shared 
glance, every laughter-filled moment, painted a 
canvas of a Valentine's Day that was beyond 
friendship. The night city lights, witnesses to our 
journey, flickered like question marks in the night, 
prompting me to reflect on the unspoken 
connections lingering between us. The laughter, 
shared glances, and the exchange of a heartfelt gift 
painted a picture that blurred the lines between 
friendship and something deeper. It was a day 
crafted in the colours of affection, leaving me with 
a perplexing question: Did our hearts secretly 
yearn for more? 
 
Page | 106  
 
In the quiet solitude of the journey home, I 
pondered the unspoken emotions that lingered in the 
spaces between us. Were we merely besties, 
playfully dancing around the truth, or were we, in 
fact, hesitant lovers afraid to admit the depth of 
our connection? The laughter, the stolen glances, 
and the genuine warmth we shared hinted at a 
connection that tiptoed on the edges of a revelation. 
Besties, right? But why did it feel like there was 
this unspoken truth lingering beneath the surface? 
 
Have you ever wondered if your heart was playing 
games with you, secretly yearning for more? As I 
trudged home, these questions hung in the night air, 
part of a larger conversation with myself about the 
untold nuances of our connection. The question 
lingered like a ghost in the night, prompting me to 
revisit the moments we had crafted together. Were 
we playfully fooling ourselves, dancing around the 
unspoken truth of our feelings? The city, now 
hushed in the afterglow of our shared fun, seemed 
to hold the answer in the subtle rustle of the night 
breeze.  
 
Page | 107  
 
As the streetlights flickered overhead, I couldn't 
escape the feeling that the day had unraveled a 
chapter in our story, one that begged exploration 
and honesty. The night became a field for 
introspection, and amidst the quietude, I grappled 
with the unspoken emotions that lingered like 
echoes in the corridors of my thoughts. As I walked 
home alone, the echoes of the day played on a loop in 
my mind. 
 
With each passing thought, I found myself caught 
between the lines of friendship and something 
more—a delicate dance that blurred the boundaries 
and left me pondering the unexplored territory of 
emotions that swirled in the wake of our unexpected 
Valentine's Day escapade. Ever been in a situation 
where the heart wants to speak a language that 
friendship hasn't quite mastered yet? It felt like 
decoding a secret message written in the stars.  
 
As the night wrapped around me, walking through 
the dimly lit streets felt like stepping into a 
cinematic scene. It's that moment when you're 
decoding a message written in the stars, each step 
Page | 108  
 
revealing a new piece of the puzzle. Have you ever 
walked through a quiet street, feeling like every 
step reveals a piece of a puzzle you're itching to 
solve? Have you ever found yourself in a tale where 
the heart's language speaks louder than friendship, 
leaving you with an itch to decode its secret 
message?  
 
Ever experienced that peculiar sensation where your 
heart seems to communicate in a language that your 
conscious mind can't fully grasp? That night, amidst 
the dilemma of our shared moments, it was as if my 
heart penned a message in invisible ink, leaving me to 
decipher its meaning. Lillian, in the mixed dance of 
emotions, seemed to be the cornerstone my heart 
had been overlooking all along. Have you ever felt 
the weight of unspoken truths, like a puzzle waiting 
to be solved? Have you ever found yourself standing 
on the verge of profound revelations, where the 
unsaid carries more weight than spoken words?  
 
As the night unfolded, there existed an unspoken 
dialogue, a conversation beyond the audible, echoing 
the depth of our connection. It was a situation 
Page | 109  
 
where the heart's language spoke volumes, leaving 
me with a sense of anticipation for the unwritten 
verses that lay ahead. In the quiet whispers of the 
night, I could still feel Lillian's presence, a silent 
revelation that perhaps there was more to our 
connection than met the eye.
