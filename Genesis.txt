GENESIS
Meeting Lillian was like stumbling upon a hidden treasure in the vast expanse of the internet. It all began during the pandemic days of COVID-19 in 2020 when the world seemed to shrink and our interactions moved online. In the midst of conducting business through cyberspace, I encountered a client with a unique energy named Agape. Little did I know, this encounter would lead me to someone special; none other than Lillian!

Agape wasn't just any ordinary client; she brought a whole new vibe to our virtual exchanges. Our conversations transcended the boundaries of business, delving into personal topics and shared interests. It was during one of these heartfelt exchanges that Agape mentioned her friend, Lillian.

Curiosity piqued, I found myself intrigued by the prospect of meeting this mysterious friend. Agape graciously facilitated our introduction, connecting me with Lillian through a phone chat. From that moment, a new chapter began.

The anticipation built as Agape and I grew closer, fueling our desire to transition from virtual acquaintances to real-life friends. We eagerly looked forward to the day when we could finally meet face-to-face. Agape promised that when that day arrived, Lillian would accompany her.

And so, the day of our meeting arrived, bringing with it a blend of excitement and nervous anticipation. As promised, Agape and Lillian appeared before me, transforming our virtual connections into tangible realities. In that meeting, I gazed upon Lillian's face for the very first time.

It's funny how life works sometimes, how chance encounters and unexpected connections can lead to the most meaningful relationships. Meeting Lillian was a serendipitous twist in the story of my life, a moment that changed everything in the most unexpected and beautiful way.

It was a typical day, sun beating down on the football pitch in the village of Buwambo. Little did I know, that seemingly ordinary day would lay the foundation for an extraordinary connection.

While at the pitch, Lillian was just a face in the background. I was specifically there to meet Agape and my attention was initially drawn to her rather than the friends who were standing alongside her.

In the casual exchange with Agape, Lillian entered the picture. Agape, being the insightful friend that she is, described Lillian as a religious person. I was intrigued, and that's when Agape bestowed the nickname "The Prayer Warrior" upon her. It added a layer of mystery and reverence to Lillian.

As we chatted briefly, Lillian's humble and simple character reflected the religious person Agape had described. At first glance, she seemed like any other girl, and our paths crossed without much fantasy. We chatted briefly, but it was nothing more than the casual conversation you would have with someone in passing.

Exchanging contacts with Lillian didn't even cross my mind. After all, in that moment, we appeared to be two people with different stories, seemingly lacking the common ground for a deeper connection. Little did I know, appearances can be deceiving.

Lillian, much like the rejected stone waiting to become a cornerstone, lingered in the background of my awareness. Our initial encounter felt like a mere ripple in the vast pond of life, but it turned out to be the first gentle wave that would shape the shores of our connection.

The threads of fate continued to weave, unaware of the intricate tapestry they were creating. That seemingly ordinary day at the football pitch, where I didn't pay much attention, would become the prologue to a love story that unfolded in the most unexpected ways. Life, as they say, had different plans.

Little did I realize, Lillian was like the rejected stone hiding in plain sight, patiently waiting for her moment to shine. The connection we didn't see coming, the conversations we didn't think we'd have â€“ it all started on that football pitch, where destiny began weaving the threads. Life has a funny way of surprising you when you least expect it.
