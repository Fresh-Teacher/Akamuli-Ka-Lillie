IT IS WHAT IT IS
Lillian and I threw caution to the wind and embraced the "It is what it is" philosophy. Forget the complicated rules of love and friendship – we were all about "What flows flows and what crashes crashes."

Picture this: no more overthinking & no more worrying about what others say. We reached that point where we thought, "Who cares what others think? Let's just do our thing!" It was liberating, to say the least.

We didn't bother drawing clear lines between friendship and a relationship. Boundaries were overrated. If we missed each other, we'd casually plan a meet-up and just have fun. We let happiness be our guide and ignored the rules.

Picture this: our love story was a rebellious dance, a rebellion against the rules that said love and friendship should adhere to a strict script. We were like, "Screw it," and let our connection unfold in its own way. 

We would decide to have an outing and grab lunch at the local spot, not some fancy joint. And you know what? Lillian simply loved it. She didn't need a five-star restaurant like Sheraton Hotel or Speke Resort; just a few snacks and a bottle of a soft drink made her day. It was a reminder that love doesn't need all the bells and whistles; sometimes, it's the simple, heartfelt moments that matter.

We were rebels with a cause – the cause of happiness. No labels, no boundaries. We just let things flow as we also follow the flow. It was a laid-back approach to love, where we didn't stress about fitting into predefined roles. Our relationship wasn't a rigid structure; it was a living, breathing entity that evolved naturally.

We discovered that love is a journey, not a destination. There were no finish lines or predetermined endpoints; every moment was a destination in itself. In a world that loves timelines, we embraced the beauty of the unknown. We wrote our own rules and found joy in the unpredictable. Our love wasn't a carefully orchestrated performance; it was a jam session, with each note representing a genuine moment between us. 

In the rebellion against traditional expectations, we discovered the beauty of simplicity. A glance became a language of its own, and shared silences held the weight of unspoken promises. Our rebellion wasn't a revolt against love; it was a celebration of its boundless forms.

In the midst of this rebellion, we discovered that love isn't a carefully scripted play but an improvisational dance where creativity takes the lead. There were no predefined roles or rehearsed lines; instead, we embraced the unpredictability, finding joy in the beautiful messiness of our connection. As we danced to our own rhythm, there was a freedom in not conforming to society's expectations. We decided to confuse those who didn't mind their own business.

The beauty of our story lied in the simplicity of following the flow. No labels, no pressure – just two people enjoying the journey, one laugh at a time. We weren't confined by labels or societal expectations; we simply were. So, if you've ever wondered what happens when you throw the rulebook out the window, well, this book spills all the delightful details. 

It wasn't about defining every moment or adhering to a predetermined script. Instead, we embraced the unpredictability, allowing our connection to evolve organically. No pressure, no checklist – just genuine companionship. We were like rebels, flipping the script on traditional romance and penning our own tale in the margins.

This was kinda a rebellion against the societal scripts that dictated how relationships should be. We were the architects of our own love story, choosing freedom over rules. As we tossed the rulebook out the window, our laughter echoed in the spaces between words. We found joy in the simplest gestures – a romantic smile, a tight hug, or a glance that spoke volumes. Love became a dance, and we were the artistes of our own rhythm.

Those unplanned meet-ups became our trademark and favourite adventures. Whether it was a random lunch, an evening walk, or just losing track of time in conversation, each moment was a celebration of our unscripted connection. The beauty of our connection lay in its unpredictability. We didn't meticulously plan every moment; instead, we allowed the magic to happen naturally.

There were no elaborate plans or calculated moves; instead, we discovered the beauty in the everyday. From funny jokes to stolen glances across crowded rooms, our connection was woven with threads of authenticity. Forget labels; we were just two people enjoying each other's company. Laughter became our anthem, and the ordinary times changed into extraordinary moments. 

The best part? We weren't afraid to be vulnerable. Love, after all, isn't about perfection but rather the acceptance of imperfections and mistakes. We celebrated our individuality, finding peace in being seen and accepted for who we truly were. We gave a collective shrug to the future expectations. We weren't afraid to let love be messy, undefined, and utterly ours.

Gone were the days of overthinking and second-guessing; instead, we embraced the simplicity of "it is what it is." Our connection became a sanctuary where judgement had no entry, and we reveled in the purity of being ourselves. It was a rebellion against the notion that love required proper planning and adherence to societal constructs.

In this chapter of our story, we discovered that love doesn't always fit neatly into categories. Sometimes, it's about breaking free from the constraints, allowing affection to blossom naturally. And let me tell you, the result was nothing short of magical.

As we navigated this uncharted territory, the only compass we followed was the compass of our hearts. There were no preconceived notions or predetermined destinies – just two souls intertwining in a journey of self-discovery and shared experiences. Our rebellion was a celebration of the beauty found in the raw, unfiltered moments.

So, if you're seeking a love story that transcends the ordinary, one where two souls dare to dance to their own rhythm, you're reading the right guide.
