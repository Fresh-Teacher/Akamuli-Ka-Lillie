THE FIRST VALENTINE GIFT 
Oh my, the good old days when I was just getting to 
know Lillian. Back then, she was just another friend 
in my circle, someone I enjoyed hanging out with but 
didn't think much of in a romantic sense. I didn't 
see her as anything more than just another buddy to 
hang out with, nothing more, nothing less. 
 
I mean, don't get me wrong, she was awesome and 
all, but the thought of gifting her something 
extravagant for Valentine's Day didn't exactly 
cross my mind. After all, we were just pals, right?  
 
I didn't exactly have heart-shaped emojis floating 
around my head whenever she walked by. In fact, if 
you had asked me what made her stand out, I 
probably wouldn't have had an answer – she was 
just...there. 
 
So when February 14th approached, I found myself 
in a bit of a dilemma, I couldn't shake the feeling 
that I should do something to show Lillian she was 
appreciated. So, I embarked on a mission to find the 
perfect token of my affection.

On one hand, I wanted to show Lillian that she was 
special to me, even if it was just as a friend. But on 
the other hand, I was clueless about what to get 
her. I mean, chocolates and flowers seemed too 
lovely, and I definitely didn't want to risk sending 
the wrong message with an overly romantic gesture. 
 
So, when Valentine's Day rolled around and everyone 
was swapping chocolates and roses, I thought, "Hey, 
why not show Lillian some love too?" But being the 
caring friend that I am (not), I didn't exactly come 
prepared with a fancy gift. And there I was, 
rummaging through my room in a last-minute panic, 
desperately searching for something – or anything – 
that could pass as a gift for Lillian. 
 
Now, you might think I had some grand, romantic 
gesture planned out, but let me burst that bubble 
right now. Nope, not even close. Instead, I checked 
through my baggage of random stuff, hoping to 
stumble upon a hidden treasure worthy of Lillian's 
affection, and stumbled upon a broken cup. Yep, you 
read that right – a broken cup. Now, you might be

wondering how on earth I thought a broken cup 
could make a suitable Valentine's Day gift. Well, 
before you judge me, let me explain. 
 
This wasn't just any broken cup. It had a story 
behind it – it was a souvenir for the Fresh Family 
and it had a group photo on it. Just like the minor 
chip at the top of the cup, the Fresh Family also had 
some little misunderstandings amongst its members. 
But despite its imperfections, it still retained its 
charm, with the handle and bottom intact. 
 
Sure, it might not have been the most conventional 
choice. I mean, who gives someone a broken cup for 
Valentine's Day, right? But hey, I was operating on a 
tight budget and even tighter deadline. Desperate 
times call for desperate measures, as they say. 
 
Well, it wasn't exactly the most romantic gesture, 
but hear me out. They often say that they are the 
thoughts which count. The damage on the cup wasn't 
too shabby – just a little damage at the top. Plus, 
the handle and bottom were still holding strong. It 
was like the cup had been through some battle scars

and come out stronger on the other side. So, in my 
mind, it was the thought that counted, right?  
 
At first glance, it seemed like an odd choice for a 
Valentine's Day gift – after all, who in their right 
mind would gift someone a broken cup? But in my 
defense, there was something oddly poetic about it. 
Maybe it was the way the fractured edges mirrored 
the imperfections of our budding friendship. It was 
like a metaphor for life – a little damaged, but still 
functional. 
 
Regardless of my reasoning, I decided to roll with it. 
After all, they say it's the thought that counts, 
right? So with a mixture of optimism and 
trepidation, I carefully wrapped up the broken cup, 
hoping that Lillian would see past its flaws and 
appreciate the sentiment behind it. 
 
To my relief (and mild surprise), Lillian's reaction 
was priceless. Instead of recoiling in horror or 
laughing me off the face of the earth, she actually 
seemed genuinely touched. Maybe it was the sheer 
absurdity of the situation or maybe she just

appreciated the effort, but either way, she 
accepted my humble offering with grace and good 
humor. 
 
And so, as we laughed together over the absurdity 
of it all, I couldn't help but feel a glimmer of hope. 
Maybe, just maybe, this broken cup was the start of 
something beautiful – a symbol of our budding 
friendship blossoming into something more. Or 
maybe it was just a reminder that when it comes to 
matters of the heart, it's the thought that truly 
counts. 
 
They say love is like glue – it can mend even the 
most broken of things. Or at least, that's what I 
told myself as I handed over my less-than-perfect 
gift. And in that moment, I realised that maybe, 
just maybe, I hadn't completely botched Valentine's 
Day after all. 
 
And you know what? Despite the less-than-ideal 
start, Lillian actually appreciated the gesture. She 
saw the humor in it, just like I did. It became a

running joke between us – the infamous broken cup 
incident. 
 
So, while my Valentine's Day gift may not have been 
the stuff of fairy tales, it was a reminder that love 
isn't always about grand gestures or expensive 
presents. Sometimes, it's the broken cups and 
laughter-filled moments that make the sweetest 
memories. 
 
Looking back, I can't help but chuckle at how 
clueless I was back then. I mean, who would've 
thought that a simple broken cup could kickstart a 
journey that would lead to something far beyond 
friendship? It just goes to show that love has a 
funny way of sneaking up on you when you least 
expect it. 
 
And so, the legend of the broken cup was born – a 
testament to the power of friendship, laughter, and 
the beauty of imperfection. And though our paths 
may have taken us on different journeys since then, 
I like to think that somewhere out there, that

broken cup is still bringing smiles to those who hear 
its tale.
