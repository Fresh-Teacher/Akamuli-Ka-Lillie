LOVE AT LAST
There I was, chilling with my best bud Bob, when Lillian rang me up. I hung up the phone and called her back then we dove into a conversation that lasted a whopping two hours until the mysterious phone gods decided to cut us off; probably for the well-being of our eardrums.

Not one to be easily deterred, I dialed her up again, and we embarked on another two-hour marathon of chatter until the phone connection again decided it had had enough. As I pondered the idea of redialing for the third round of another two-hour talkathon, Bob, with a raised eyebrow, chimed in, "Hold on, did you secretly acquire a girlfriend without informing your trusted friend?" I couldn't help but chuckle at the absurdity of the notion. I assured him there was no secret girlfriend; it was just Lillian, my Bestie. Bob, being the detective of our friendship, suspected there was more to the story.

Setting the record straight, I clarified that Lillian was, indeed, the one occupying those two-hour conversation slots. Bob, not one to back down from a mystery, insisted there was more to it and dropped the bombshell suggestion – "Why not take it up a notch? Make her your fiancée!" The man sure knew how to stir the pot! 

With a hearty laugh, I dismissed Bob's proposal, thinking he might have overdosed on detective novels. Yet, deep down, his words sparked a quirky thought – could my prolonged phone chats with Lillian signify something beyond friendship? Was there a hidden layer to my connection with Lillian that went beyond the boundaries of mere friendship?

We both laughed it off, but deep down, Bob's words lingered. Was there more to my connection with Lillian than just a friendly chat? The idea floated around my mind as we continued our day, unknowingly stepping into a realm where friendships held the potential to bloom into something more. While I couldn't deny the comedic value in his suggestion, I reassured him that Lillian and I were firmly in the "Besties" zone. But Bob, persistent as ever, insisted that perhaps the laughter and endless conversations hinted at something deeper.

"Fiancée her!" he shouted, as if proposing to level up our friendship was the most logical next step. The suggestion of Lillian as a potential fiancée lingered injected our chat with an extra dose of humour. This idea of taking our friendship to the next level played hide-and-seek in the corners of my mind. As we discussed about it, Bob continued suggesting that maybe, just maybe, Lillian and I were tiptoeing on the edge of a budding romance. The absurdity of it all tickled our funny bones.

With laughter echoing in the air, I debunked the idea that Lillian was my undercover love interest. Bob's suggestion to fast-track things to fiancée status sounded like a joke. I mean, imagine turning a casual two-hour chat into a proposal-worthy scenario – the absurdity was too good to ignore. Yet, beneath the laughter, a tiny seed of curiosity was planted. Could there be more to my connection with Lillian than our spirited conversations? It was a thought that lingered, teasing the edges of our banter-filled day.

We dissected our lengthy conversations, attempting to uncover hidden meanings or secret codes. Were those two-hour talks just the tip of the iceberg in a sea of unspoken emotions? As the banter continued, the concept of taking things up a notch lingered in the background, like a mischievous muse whispering hilarious possibilities. Bob, ever the witty sidekick, insisted that our epic phone conversations had the makings of a romantic saga. Could the saga include a dazzling proposal scene? The thought had me chuckling.

Bob, the self-proclaimed love guru of our duo, insisted we explore the possibility. "Why not take it to the next level? What's the harm in turning your bestie into a fiancée?" he quipped, clearly relishing the role of an unconventional matchmaker. The humour of the situation didn't escape us, and we laughed until our sides ached, realising that sometimes, the best stories are the ones written in the margins of friendship. 

Bob, the self-proclaimed Love Master, had concocted a master plan to expose the truth of Lillian's feelings. The plot? The grand plan involved inviting her to our hometown in Masaka, a solid four-hour journey from Kampala – no small feat by any means. Because, let's face it, a person wouldn't embark on such a pilgrimage unless there was a genuine relationship, right? According to Bob's unwritten rulebook of love, if a girl is willing to travel a hundred-mile journey just to meet a boy, well, it speaks volumes about her feelings for him.

The proposition was both intriguing and nerve-wracking. Could a simple invitation become the litmus test for hidden emotions? As I mulled over the plan, the idea of Lillian travelling the distance to our hometown became a romantic adventure. Bob, ever the strategist, believed that actions spoke louder than words, and a journey to my roots could unveil secrets that words might hide. Bob's hypothesis was clear – if she agreed to this adventure, there would be no room for doubt; the signs would point unmistakably towards a deeper connection. It was the kind of move that tested the waters, pushing beyond the boundaries of casual friendship into the realm of potential romantic interest. 

Armed with Bob's strategic advice, I hesitantly extended the invitation to Lillian. The proposal hung in the air, a silent challenge that awaited her response. Would the prospect of a road trip, combined with the prospect of meeting my family, be enough to tip the scales of our connection? Would this bold move be the turning point in our dynamic, or would it add yet another layer to the enigmatic dance of friendship and potential romance? The answer lay in her response, a litmus test for the unspoken sentiments lingering between us. Only time would tell as the wheels of this peculiar love story continued to turn. 

To my surprise, Lillian didn't hesitate. She embraced the invitation with enthusiasm, ready to embark on a journey that would take her not only to Masaka City but also into the heart of my village. The confirmation of her willingness to traverse both physical and emotional distances for our connection added a new dimension to our evolving narrative. The wheels were set in motion for a journey that held the promise of discovery – not just of geographical landscapes but, more importantly, of the depth of our connection. As we awaited her arrival in Masaka, Bob couldn't help but revel in the success of his matchmaking plot, a playful scheme that had evolved into a genuine exploration of emotions and possibilities.

As the day approached, I couldn't shake off the blend of excitement and nerves. The dusty roads of Masaka were about to witness a love story in the making, orchestrated by the unexpected orchestrator, Bob. It all painted a picture of possibilities that stretched beyond the miles between Kampala and Masaka. The stage was set for a unique blend of hospitality and the blossoming of a connection that had travelled its own distance, metaphorical and real. Little did we know that this journey would become a milestone, a marker in the timeline of our friendship evolving into something more. 

By the time Lillian reached Masaka Town, the stars were already hanging in the ink-black sky above, watching the whole show. The sun had bid its adieu, casting a veil of darkness over the landscape. Her arrival was met with the customary exchange of greetings with my parents in the village. It was a brief pitstop, for the night was young, and the next item on our agenda was a visit to none other than the legendary Bob's place in the fading light of the evening. Now, this was the moment of truth – the convergence of my two worlds. It was the first time Lillian and Bob would see each other, bridging the gap between my Best Friend and the so-called female Bestie who had unwittingly become the gist of our adventures.

As we approached Bob's abode, you could almost taste the excitement in the air. Would the dynamic duo of Best Friend and Bestie hit it off? Lillian and I planned to tease him by making him believe that she had not managed to make it. The door swung open when I knocked, revealing Bob's grin – a mix of excitement and curiosity. He looked around and the only person he could see was me. He was shocked because I had promised to visit him with Lillian. When I told him that Lillian had let me down, I saw anger boiling up in his eyes.

In a loud voice, he screamed, "Urgh! Why didn't she come yet you sent her transport?!"

Lillian couldn't dare for more insults about her so she came out of hiding. We all laughed till our jaws hurt! The night unfolded like a well-scripted comedy, laughter echoing against the walls of Bob's place. The tales we spun and the jokes we cracked formed the foundation of an unexpected friendship. In that moment, Masaka became the stage for a meetup between friends who had, until then, existed in separate orbits. The exchange of greetings was accompanied by an air of familiarity, as if the universe had crafted this meeting long before we even knew, weaving the threads of friendship and bestie-ship.

Bob's welcome wasn't just a handshake or a hello; it was an initiation into the club of inside jokes and shared adventures. His joy was palpable, like three missing puzzle pieces finally finding each other. The trio – Bob, Lillian, and I – stood under the Masaka night sky, ready to create a new chapter in our story.

Beneath the Masaka night sky, with stars winking as silent witnesses of the unfolding drama, laughter became the soundtrack of our amazing reunion. The stories flowed like a river, and the connection between Lillian and Bob seamlessly blended. It was a night brimming with the promise of unexpected adventures and the kind of magic that unfolds when the stars align – both in the sky and in the bonds of friendship. 

As the night ticked away, we found ourselves caught in the magic of the unexpected. What happens when my Best Friend meets my Bestie? A concoction of shared stories, laughter, and the promise of adventures yet to unfold. The stars above the dark sky seemed to wink knowingly, as if they, too, were in on the secret – that friendships, like constellations, can align in the most unexpected ways.

Imagine the night of December 31st 2023. It was the last night of the year, the air filled with anticipation, and Lillian, the Prayer Warrior, had a plan to usher in the new year in the most divine way possible – at the church's prayer grounds. I agreed and we travelled to the sacred place where the overnight was going to take place. Now, I'm not exactly the night owl extraordinaire—I usually hit the pillow at 8 PM sharp. But for the sake of festivities, I willingly signed up for the overnight extravaganza, blissfully ignorant of the trials that awaited me.

Surrounded by fellow worshippers, we stood amidst the congregation, our prayers rising like a harmonious melody. As the clock inched closer to midnight, we found ourselves surrounded by the soft glow of lights, the murmur of prayers rising like a melody. The atmosphere was charged with a sense of collective hope, a congregation joined in spirit to bid farewell to the old and embrace the unknown of the new.

The minutes melted away. The energy in the air intensified and there was a palpable energy. Lillian, standing tall with her unwavering faith, stood amidst the worshippers, her prayers blending with the chorus of others, creating a symphony of hopes, dreams, and aspirations for the coming year. Minutes slipped away, and the atmosphere brimmed with a mix of excitement and reverence. 

You see, I'm not exactly a night owl; my usual routine involves bidding farewell to consciousness at around 8 PM. But this overnight business had different plans for me – plans that involved resisting the sweet siren call of sleep until the clock struck midnight. So, diving into the realm of overnights was like exploring a foreign land for me. 

As the clock ticked away, pushing me into the late hours, I could feel the weight of sleep descending upon me. My eyelids waged a valiant battle against the forces of gravity. Picture this: it's nearing midnight, and yours truly is fighting to keep his eyes open! By the time midnight rolled around, I was staggering on the brink between consciousness and the dreamland. I might as well have been sleepwalking through the countdown.

Then, out of nowhere, boom! The clock struck twelve, marking the birth of a new year, and the skies erupted in a dazzling display of fireworks. By the time the clock struck twelve, I was halfway between reality and dreamland. The loud fireworks startled me awake, and for a moment, I thought we were under attack. Bullets and bombs? Nope, just fireworks. Phew!

In my sleepy confusion, my brain played a little prank on me. Now, don't get me wrong, I was fully aware that fireworks were on the agenda, but in my sleepy state, those vibrant bursts of light took me by surprise. For a moment, I was convinced we were in the middle of a midnight action packed movie, and those weren't fireworks but the sounds of rapid-fire bullets raining down! I kid you not; I almost pulled a Houdini and vanished into the night, thinking bullets were raining down around me.

Cue my half-awake, half-dreaming self contemplating a hasty escape. Picture me, eyes wide open, disoriented, and ready to pull off some ninja moves to dodge the imaginary bullets. Oh, the things the mind conjures in the haze of post-midnight exhaustion! If only I could've captured that moment – the night I almost mistook fireworks for a covert mission! In my groggy state, the initial instinct was to run away and save my dear life, but thank God, reality quickly caught up.

But, alas, it wasn't a covert military operation—it was just the universe celebrating another trip around the sun. Note to self: next time, wear headsets to reduce on the shock of the loud fireworks!

Back to business, it wasn't just fireworks illuminating the sky but the collective glow of a hundred hearts, hopeful for a fresh start. The transition from the old to the new wasn't just a flip of the calendar; it was a spiritual journey guided by the shared belief in the endless possibilities of a new beginning.

In the silence that followed the prayers, there was a sense of peace, a moment to reflect on the past and embrace the future. As we stepped into the first moments of the new year, there was a quiet joy, knowing that whatever lay ahead, we faced it with faith, hope, and the strength drawn from a night spent in the company of prayers. 

In the end, the overnight became a battleground where my love for sleep clashed with the demands of a nocturnal celebration. I swear next time Lillian asks me to attend another overnight, I'll challenge her to take me to an "Overday" instead. Hope she is not reading this. 

Well, that overnight adventure took an unexpected turn! The cold mist decided to crash our party, and suddenly my warm bed at home sounded like a much better idea. A mix of the cold and growing discomfort had me shaking like a leaf, turning this New Year's prayer session into a chilly challenge. Shivers – a combo of the cold and the impending discomfort – turned me into a teeth-chattering orchestra.

According to my nature, I have a very sensitive body which can't endure some situations like coldness.  So, with a collective nod of agreement, we admitted defeat to the biting cold and decided it was time to head home. Even sleep, my reliable buddy, couldn't handle the ice cold conditions and made a swift exit. Talk of a betrayal, right?

We flagged down a cyclist, thinking a swift ride would rescue us from the icy night. Little did I know that the brisk journey through the chilly air would make things worse. Every gust felt like a bunch of icy needles piercing my skin, turning those shivers into uncontrollable full-blown shudders.

The journey home felt like an eternity, and with the shivers reaching peak levels, we made a spontaneous call to stop at Bob's place. It turned out to be a smart move to escape the cold. But here's the kicker— Lillian, being the sweetheart she is, wrapped me up in her arms. That not only melted away the frozen shivers but also sent me into a cozy state. It was a sanctuary from the biting cold, and in the warm embrace of Lillian's hug, the teeth chattering gradually calmed down.

It wasn't just a warming-up session; it turned into a cozy lullaby that gently nudged me into a contented doze. The warmer I got, the sleepier I became. Eventually, I dozed off in Lillian's embrace. And there you have it, in the centre of Lillian's warm hug, listening to the rhythm of her heart beat, I surrendered to the sweet call of sleep. Romance found its way into this unexpected moment, turning it into a tale worth remembering – love conquering the cold in a tight hug. ❄

As we nestled into each other's warmth at Bob's place, Lillian playfully poked a finger into my chest, her eyes gleaming with curiosity. "So, tell me about your family in the village," she urged.

I straightened up, suddenly feeling the weight of her question. "Well," I began, clearing my throat for emphasis, "my parents may seem friendly, but they're anything but. Did you happen to catch a glimpse of the dark-skinned woman when we stopped by our home in last evening?"

Lillian nodded, her fingers lazily tracing circles on my chest as she listened intently. "Yes, I did. Who is she?" she inquired, her curiosity piqued.

"That's Maama Mirembe," I explained, "my auntie and the elder sister of my mother. She's my auntie, my mother's elder sister. Let me tell you, she's one tough cookie, let me tell you. You better make sure you're dressed to the nines whenever you're in her presence, or else have a field day poking fun at you for your indecent attire."

Lillian's eyes widened in shock as she sat up to process the information, giving way to genuine concern. She then exclaimed, "Why didn't you tell me about all of this before I came? If I had known, I wouldn't have even stepped a foot in Masaka!" Her regret for agreeing to visit Masaka was palpable, and I couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt for not fully preparing her for what lay ahead.

I couldn't help but chuckle at her reaction. Wrapping my arms around her, I reassured her that Maama Mirembe's bark was worse than her bite. "Don't worry, I'll be there to protect you," I reassured her with a grin. "Besides, Maama Mirembe may be tough, but deep down, she's got a heart of gold. You'll see."

After all, facing your fears is part of life's journey, and I knew that together, we could handle whatever came our way. Lillian shot me a skeptical glance, but a small smile tugged at the corners of her lips. "Well, let's hope so," she said. 

Lillian expressed her apprehension about meeting my formidable parents, especially Maama Mirembe, and I couldn't blame her. I reassured her that while Maama Mirembe could be a tough nut to crack if you stepped out of line, my real mother was as down-to-earth as I myself.

"You'll be fine," I told her, offering a comforting squeeze of her hand. "Just be yourself, and they'll love you."

But despite my attempts to ease her nerves, Lillian remained unconvinced. She recounted the old Baganda saying "Okusanga Nyazaala Osanga Amalaalo," which roughly translates to "You would rather meet a grave than meet your mother-in-law."

In that same vein, Lillian was visibly anxious about the prospect of meeting my serious auntie, especially after hearing about Maama Mirembe's character. She kept expressing her concerns, worrying about making a good impression and fearing Maama Mirembe's judgment. But I emphasised that my real mother, Mama, was a laid-back, just like me. As for Maama Mirembe, well, let's just say she had her own unique way of doing things. I shared stories of my childhood, highlighting my mother's warmth and kindness, hoping to ease Lillian's nerves.

I grinned as I tried to ease Lillian's tension, explaining that while Maama Mirembe could be a tough nut to crack if you stepped out of line, she was actually quite friendly and welcoming if you played your cards right; she could be even warmer and more welcoming than my own dear mum!

 "Trust me," I said with a reassuring smile, "once she sees what a wonderful person you are, she'll warm up to you in no time."

With a sigh, she lamented accepting the invitation to visit Masaka from Kampala, fearing the inevitable encounter with Maama Mirembe. As much as I tried to lighten the mood with jokes and reassurances, the thought of meeting my strict auntie weighed heavily on her mind.

I couldn't help but laugh at her dramatic interpretation of the situation, but I understood her concerns. After all, meeting parents for the first time can be a daunting experience for anyone. But I assured her that everything would be fine and that my family would love her just as much as I did. With a gentle pat at her back, I encouraged her to give it a chance and promised to be right by her side every step of the way.

With a heavy heart, I tried to persuade Lillian to accompany me to the village and meet my parents, but all my efforts seemed to fall on deaf ears. Frustration began to creep in as I started to contemplate leaving her behind at Bob's place and embarking on the journey alone.

Initially, she seemed to agree with my decision to go solo, but upon further reflection, she realized that spending the day alone while I visited my family wasn't exactly the plan for a fun outing she had in mind. After a moment of internal debate and weighing her options, she reluctantly decided to swallow her fears and join me on the trip, crossing her fingers and hoping for the best outcome, she swallowed her fears and agreed to accompany me to the village, crossing her fingers in hope for the best. 

Though she still looked afraid, a small smile played on her lips as she leaned into my embrace. "I guess we'll just have to wait and see," she said with a sigh. "But if I come back with my figure still intact, you owe me a big favour. I'm sure I'll grow thin in one day!"

Nevertheless, as we made our way down the winding roads towards the village, I couldn't help but admire Lillian's courage and determination to face her fears head-on. With her by my side, I felt a newfound sense of confidence and reassurance, knowing that together, we could tackle whatever challenges came our way.

When we set off together, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and admiration for Lillian's bravery. Though the road ahead was uncertain, I knew that with her by my side, we could overcome any obstacles that came our way. With renewed determination and a shared sense of adventure, we embarked on our journey to the village, ready to face whatever awaited us.

As we embarked on our journey to the village, I could sense Lillian's nervousness, her fingers fidgeting with the hem of her dress. I reached out and gently squeezed her hand, offering what little comfort I could muster. "Don't worry, everything will be fine," I assured her, though I couldn't help but feel a twinge of anxiety myself.

With Lillian's hand clasped tightly in mine, we stepped into our neighbourhood and made our way towards my parents' home, ready to face whatever awaited us with courage and determination. Whatever the outcome, I knew that with Lillian by my side, we could handle anything that came our way.
Upon arriving at home, I could see the tension written all over Lillian's face. However, to our pleasant surprise, we were greeted with warm smiles and open arms by my parents, who welcomed us with genuine hospitality and kindness.

The warmth of their reception caught Lillian off guard, and she couldn't help but wonder if I had been teasing her about my aunt, Maama Mirembe, all along. As we settled into the cozy embrace of my family home, any lingering doubts or fears quickly melted away, replaced by a sense of comfort and belonging.

My parents went out of their way to make Lillian feel at home, engaging her in lively conversation and showering her with warmth and affection. Their genuine hospitality and kindness put Lillian at ease, and she soon found herself relaxing into the warmth of our family's embrace.

 I stole a glance at Lillian, who was sitting beside me with a nervous yet determined expression on her face. I shot her a reassuring smile, silently urging her to stay calm. Despite the uncertainty of what lay ahead, I couldn't help but feel a surge of gratitude towards her for taking this leap of faith with me.

Lillian handled herself with grace and poise as she engaged in polite conversation with my family. I couldn't help but feel a swell of pride in my chest as I watched her interact with them, her genuine warmth shining through.

Lillian, ever the gracious soul, seamlessly integrated into the rhythm of rural life, spending the entire day lending a helping hand to my parents as they prepared for the festive celebrations. Lillian not only embraced our customs but also became a beacon of warmth in our familial bonds.

As the day progressed, Lillian's nerves began to ease, replaced by a sense of comfort and belonging. She laughed and joked with my siblings, her laughter blending seamlessly with the sounds of family chatter around us.

She turned to me with a grateful smile, her eyes sparkling with newfound confidence. "Thanks for convincing me to come," she said softly, her voice filled with sincerity. 

"I'm glad I did." I returned her smile, feeling a weight lift off my shoulders. Together, we had conquered yet another hurdle in our journey, emerging stronger and closer than ever before. And as we settled in for the evening, surrounded by the warmth of friendship and love, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would face them together, hand in hand.

In the heart of the village, amid the laughter and anticipation, Lillian became an integral part of our New Year's festivities. The air was filled with the tantalising aroma of festive dishes, and the laughter of children playing echoed in the background. Lillian's warmth and kindness added an extra layer of joy to the celebratory atmosphere. It wasn't just a new year; it was a day etched with the bonds of friendship and the spirit of togetherness.

As the day unfolded into a canvas of celebration, we reveled in the simple joys – from shared meals to laughter-filled conversations. Lillian, standing beside us, seamlessly became a cherished member of the family, weaving her warmth into the fabric of our New Year's tale.

Finally, food was ready and it was lunch time! Oh, brace yourself for the cultural shock of a lifetime! Our dear Lillian, the city-born queen, was about to embark on a dinner adventure like never before – a journey into the heart of village dining. For your information, our village dining experience is a masterclass in simplicity, a far cry from the refined city dining Lillian was accustomed to.

So, here we are in the village, right? Now, imagine this: instead of the fancy dining tables and polished cutlery that Lillian is used to in the city, we roll out the red (or should I say green?) carpet of banana leaves on the ground. Yep, you heard that right – no tables, just a leafy feast waiting to happen! In the village, we don't mess around with forks and spoons and other cutlery – that's just not how we do it. We go straight to the roots, or should I say, FINGERS!

Picture this: a rustic setting in the heart of the village, banana leaves spread out on the ground, and saucepans of local delicacies placed right in the center. Now, in the city, they may call this a picnic; in the village, it's our dining table. No polished cutlery graced our humble feast – only the tool bestowed upon us by nature itself: OUR FINGERS!

Here comes the plot twist – forget about fancy forks and spoons; we're talking bare fingers here. That's right, Lillian, the sophisticated urbanite, was about to trade her utensils for the most ancient and authentic eating tools known to humankind – HER FINGERS!

As the food made its grand entrance, perched proudly in the center of our leafy banquet, Lillian had that look of bewilderment mixed with excitement. No forks? No problem! It was time for a crash course in finger-lickin' village dining. You could practically see the question marks hovering over her head as she navigated this new frontier of finger food. Forks may have felt like second nature to her, but in the village, our fingers are the unsung heroes of gastronomy. The food, proudly sitting at the center of the banana leaf stage, awaited its fate – and ours too.

Oh, the great village feast! The scene was set – banana leaves spread like a makeshift tablecloth on the ground, food laid out in the center, and a bunch of excited villagers eagerly eyeing the delicious delights. But for our dear Lillian, the City Born, it was like stepping into a gastronomic time machine - just the raw, unfiltered experience of digging in with BARE FINGERS.

In the city, dining is a sophisticated affair, with tables, cutlery, and the whole shebang. But oh no, not at Kiyimbwe Village! Here, we embrace the earthy simplicity of laying banana leaves on the ground, creating a rustic dining tableau that is the epitome of village charm. It's like a culinary picnic, but with a generous sprinkle of village flair.

Now, imagine the look on Lillian's face when she realized that forks and spoons were not on the menu. Instead, our trusty fingers were the utensils of choice. It was a revelation for her – a crash course in the fine art of finger-lickin' good village dining. No cutlery, no toothpicks, just good ol' hands-on experience.

As Lillian surveyed this unconventional dining setup, a look of confusion danced across her face. The absence of forks and spoons must have felt like a culinary rebellion, a surprise, maybe a shock, she hadn't seen coming. The village, unfazed by the absence of utensils, embraced the age-old tradition of communal dining where the tactile engagement of fingers with food reigns supreme.

As we gathered around this local leafy banquet, Lillian's eyes widened in delightful horror. No fancy cutlery, no meticulously set dining table – just the sheer simplicity of village life. The look on her face was priceless, as if she'd just discovered a whole new dimension of dining.

There she sat, a city-born soul in a village feast, facing the challenge of consuming a meal without the crutch of utensils. The locals, adept at this finger-food fiesta, dug in with gusto, while Lillian navigated the uncharted territory of eating with her bare hands. A hilarious initiation into the rustic charm of village life! Spoiler alert: she dove right in! The village culinary experience doesn't come with a user manual; you simply go with the flow, or in this case, with the food.

Cue the laughter as Lillian tentatively dipped her fingers into the communal feast. It was her initiation into the finger-licking, no-fork-needed, village-style eating extravaganza. Forks? Who needs them when you have the exquisite pleasure of embracing your food with the warmth of your own fingertips!

Oh, the amused glances exchanged as she tentatively explored the art of finger-lickin' goodness! The village, a seasoned maestro in the orchestration of communal meals, welcomed Lillian into its fold with laughter and shared bites. For her, it was a gastronomic adventure; for us, a delightful spectacle of city meets village in the realm of dining etiquette—or lack thereof. 

Oh, the joy of witnessing someone from the city adapting to the village ways! The banana leaves, the lack of forks, and the communal feast turned lunchtime into a cultural comedy. There we were, a merry band of villagers and one urbanite, enjoying our feast with the simplicity of bare fingers. She tentatively joined the finger-food frenzy, and let me tell you, the joy of embracing the local way of dining was written all over her face. 

As the sun dipped below the horizon, signaling the arrival of the first day of the New Year, 2024, we gathered as a united front, with Lillian by our side. The celebrations unfolded with a unique blend of tradition and newfound connections, and in those moments, it felt like the universe itself was raising a toast to the beauty of shared experiences and the promise of a year yet to unfold. The celebrations weren't just about marking time but about cherishing the connections that transformed ordinary moments into extraordinary memories.

As the evening wore on, Lillian's initial plans to leave for Kampala that evening began to fade away. Instead, she made the spontaneous decision to spend the night with us, eager to soak in the warmth and hospitality of my family for a little while longer.

It was a decision she didn't regret, as we spent the evening sharing stories, laughter, and good food in the company of my loving family. As we settled in for the night, I couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude for the unexpected turn of events that had brought us all together.

So, you know what? I decided to embark on this daring mission. I summoned my parents for a top-secret meeting, you know, the kind that involves discussing matters of the heart. I decided to get a little "parental guidance" to figure out if Lillian is truly the one for me. I mean, who needs dating apps when you have the wisdom of your lovely mom and auntie, right?

I casually strolled into the living room, sipping on my juice box (because adulting is hard), and threw out the bombshell question, "What do you think of Lillian?" I was expecting a casual response like, "Oh, she's nice," or "She's well-behaved." But oh no, my parents, being the dramatic geniuses they are, commended her like she's a Nobel Prize winner for being the Most Well-Behaved Human. I know my parents are loving people and if I got married every time they recommended someone, I'd have a wedding ceremony scheduled for every weekend.

Intrigued by their rave reviews, I took the plunge and asked more clearly, "Is she, like, the one?" You know, the 'ride-or-die, share-my-mobile-money-pin' kind of one.

They exchanged a knowing glance like they were in on some grand conspiracy, nodded in unison, and started praising Lillian like she was a saint who had just cured world hunger. According to them, she's a well-behaved angel who probably flosses her teeth with rainbows!

Without missing a beat, they both looked at each other, chuckled, and replied, "Of course, she is! When do you plan to marry her?" 

I almost choked on my drink. I mean, come on! We're not even at the "What's your favourite bed side?" stage, and my parents are already planning the wedding! Well, there you have it. No need for cheesy love notes or heart-to-heart talks. I've got parental approval. 

Bob, as if he was the family spokesperson, chimed in with a monologue about Lillian that could rival Shakespeare. He practically handed me a bouquet and said, "Take her as your wife, my good sir!" I didn't know whether to laugh or start planning a wedding.

He spoke volumes about Lillian, and I was just waiting for him to pull out a PowerPoint presentation with pie charts and graphs about her awesomeness. And then, as if he was the president of the Lillian Fan Club, he proposed that I take her as my wife. 

But wait, did I actually ask Lillian if she loves me? Nah, I didn't bother asking her. Why? Because I'm a mind reader, of course. I already know she loves me thrice as much as I think. Why thrice, you ask? Well, it just sounds like a good, solid number. No scientific basis here, just good old-fashioned guesswork. It's like a mathematical equation, but with more heart emojis.

Let me tell you, folks, I've mastered the art of avoiding the crucial questions. Why bother asking Lillian if she loves me? I mean, come on, it's a given. Some things in life are just universally acknowledged, and my romantic appeal falls into that category. It's like asking if roses smell sweet or if lilies are cute.  

I can picture Lillian right now, reading this and shaking her head with an eye roll saying, "Hmm, he says I love him thrice as much as he thinks? Shame upon him!" 

So, Lillian, if you're reading this – and let's be honest, you probably are – just know that my parents are rooting for us, Bob is practically planning our wedding, and I've already taken the liberty of assuming you love me thrice as much as I think. The next stage is set for a love story that the Late Romeo and Juliet, Jack and Rose and Shakespeare would most probably feel jealous of! 

I❤U
