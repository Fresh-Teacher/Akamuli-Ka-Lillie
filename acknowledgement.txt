ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
Hey you, yes, you! First off, major kudos for picking up "Love at Last Sight." You've just started on a wild ride through my love saga, and I'm thrilled you're along for the adventure.

Now, let's get real. If you've ever danced in the crazy world of love, you're gonna find bits of this story strangely familiar. I mean, who hasn't questioned their choices in the wild maze of romance?

Big shoutout to my amazing friend, Bob, for being the catalyst behind this adventure. His encouragement and belief in our tale gave it wings. If you happen to come across his book, "The Eye," or listen to the tune of his song about my girlfriend named "Akamuli ka Lillie," you won't remain the same.

Now, let me talk about the real VIP – my incredible girlfriend, Lillian. Where do I even begin? You, my love, are the heartbeat of this story. This tale wouldn't have come to life without you – my partner in crime romance, my personal person, and the love of my life. This story is a celebration of us, our journey, and the love that has woven itself into every chapter. Without you, these pages would be empty, and my heart would be missing its beat. This journey, this love story, is as much yours as it is mine.  
And to you, dear reader, thanks a bunch for diving into the world we've painted with love. Your decision to walk alongside us in this journey means the world to me. May our story inspire you, bring smiles, and maybe even a tear or two. Cheers to you, the unseen but vital character in our love-filled adventure.

Before we kick off this love extravaganza, here's a wild fact: what you're about to read is just the tip of the iceberg. Like seriously, if I jotted down every tiny detail of my wild ride with Lillian, I would actually write a lot of books which would make up a library exclusively filled with our love chronicles. 

But hey, let's be real. I spared you the full saga and picked out the juiciest, most heart-pounding moments. So buckle up and prepare for a journey that's just a sneak peek of the love birds; that is Lillian and I. Get ready for a ride filled with laughter, unexpected twists and turns, and, most importantly, the discovery of true love at last. Ready for the drama? Let's dive in!
