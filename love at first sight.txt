LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
Now, Lillian and I had been sailing smoothly in the Bestie Zone, cruising through the waves of friendship. We weren't ready to lose each other, and the mere thought of a potential breakup sent shivers down our spines. 

As Lillian and I navigated the delicate balance of our "Besties with a Crush" dynamic, we found ourselves dancing on the edge of a budding romance. Despite the undeniable chemistry and the way we played the roles of lovers in public, there were unspoken boundaries that held us back. We found ourselves acting as lovers in public, yet privately restricted by the fear of jeopardising the precious friendship we cherished.

The fear of jeopardising our deep friendship with the uncertainties of becoming lovers lingered in the background. It was like walking on a tightrope, where one wrong move could lead to a downfall. Our connection was a beautiful enigma, not quite a confirmed romantic relationship but more than mere friendship. Recognising the limitations of our Bestie Zone, I decided to venture beyond its boundaries in search of a different kind of connection. 

But alas, as nature has a funny way of demanding companionship, loneliness knocked on my door. The universe seemed to be nudging me, reminding me that love is a basic need. Now, I didn't want to ignore this call from nature, so I set out on a quest for a love partner. The decision to seek a romantic partner emerged as a natural response to the innate human desire for connection. Little did I know that I was about to dive headfirst into an abyss of romantic chaos.

Enter Makerere University, the unsuspecting stage for the unfolding drama. It was a day like any other at campus when I crossed paths with a fellow student. Little did I know that this encounter would set in motion a series of events that would challenge my understanding of love. 

Picture this: the sun-kissed the Freedom Square, students going about their day, and love lingering in the air like the mischievous Cupid playing its love arrow shooting game. As I walked through the vibrant scene, little did I know that a twist of fate awaited me around the next corner.

As I strolled through campus, minding my own business, I didn't anticipate that destiny had a surprise in store for me. There she was, this mysterious babe who seemed to have dropped straight outta heaven. It was one of those moments when time seems to slow down, and the world fades away, leaving only the two of us in a fleeting encounter. They say, "Don't look back once you've passed someone of the opposite gender. It's a trap!" But alas, I fell right into it.

As I passed by her, an invisible force compelled me to defy the unwritten rule. I turned my head for a second glance, only to find her doing the same. And there, in that brief moment, our eyes met – a silent acknowledgment of an unspoken connection. Our eyes met in a momentary connection that sent an invisible spark through the air. A quick diversion of gazes followed thereafter, as if we were both playing a game of hide-and-seek.

But hold your laughter because the comedy of errors was just beginning. As we played this awkward game of glances – a ballet of "I see you, but I won't admit it." Lo and behold, she had fallen for the same trick, looking back just as I did. It was a comical dance of curiosity that would make Shakespeare question his romantic plotlines.

A few steps down the path, curiosity got the better of me and once again, it made me to defy the age-old advice of "never look back twice when you meet someone of the opposite gender." I couldn't resist the urge to steal another glance, and to my surprise, she too had succumbed to the same magnetic pull of curiosity. So, all the dilemma began when I made that cardinal mistake of looking back. Surprise, she did too! And just like that, the game of romantic cat and mouse began. Our eyes met, and in that split second, it felt like the universe hit the pause button just for us. I changed my direction, quite literally chasing after love. 

With each exchanged look, the invisible thread between us seemed to tighten. In a moment of spontaneous decision, I abandoned my original path and changed direction, choosing to chase after the serendipitous connection that fate had woven into our encounter. Little did I know that this impromptu pursuit would set the stage for a romantic journey filled with laughter, surprises, and the delightful unpredictability of love's mischievous games. 

The classic blunder of looking back! They say curiosity killed the cat, but in my case, it just opened doors for a series of events. Here's a tip for all the aspiring love-struck explorers out there: when you pass someone of the opposite sex, just keep walking and don't look back – it'll save you from Cupid's Arrow.

Now, let me tell you, chasing someone on campus is not as smooth as the movies make it seem. As I changed my direction to catch up with this mysterious enchantress, I found myself doing an unintentional jig – part shuffle, part goofy skip. Picture it: a one-man parade, with me as the unwitting star, trying to impress someone who probably had no idea I was attempting to join their journey.

I had this mental image of myself as the dashing hero, chasing after his love interest. Reality, however, had other plans. My attempt at a smooth approach turned into a comical display of zigzags and missteps. If only I could have seen myself from a distance – a real-life cartoon character on a pursuit filled with hilarity. But hey, in the grand scheme of things, the awkwardness was just a seasoning to add flavour to our eventual story. They say laughter is the best medicine, and let me tell you, my unintentional campus caper surely provided a good chuckle – a prelude to the laughter-filled moments that would become a staple in our journey of love.

So, there I was, chasing after this captivating figure, not with the grace of a romantic lead, but with the charm of a character in a feel-good movie. Little did I know that this chase would mark the beginning of a tale filled unpredictability that makes every love story uniquely its own. As I closed the distance, the campus seemed to transform into our own romantic backdrop. The Freedom Square, usually a place of academic and graduation coronation ceremonies, became the setting for our meet-cute. And there she was, standing amidst the academic hustle and bustle, probably wondering why she had unintentionally attracted the attention of a slightly clumsy, yet utterly intrigued pursuer.

Finally, our eyes met again, this time without the sudden turns or goofy moves. It was a genuine moment of acknowledgment, and in that instant, the campus became our own enchanted realm where love in the air echoed and the awkward dance of chasing turned into a rhythm only we understood.

You know, they say love can find you in the most unexpected places, and in our case, it happened in the midst of a campus chase that felt more like a scene from a movie sketch. But isn't that the beauty of it all? Love doesn't always follow a script; sometimes, it chooses to dance with us in the most amusing and unconventional ways. And so, the chase that began with a clumsy shuffle became the opening chapter of a story that embraced the humor in our journey, making every misstep a part of the romantic narrative we were weaving together. 

OMG! The timeless line, "Have we ever met before?"— a classic icebreaker that opened the door to a world of possibilities. In that moment, the campus seemed to quiet down, as if granting us a space to craft the next chapter of our story. With a shy yet inviting smile, she responded with those magical words, "No, but we can get to know each other. My name is Chosen Zion and you?" 

In that moment of exchanging names, I decided to go beyond the ordinary. As Chosen Zion revealed her name, I felt a shift in the universe, a cosmic alignment of sorts. The air was charged with possibilities, and I seized the opportunity to infuse a touch of creativity into our introduction.

"Call me Jesse Paul," I declared with a twinkle in my eye, wanting to contribute my own unique note to the symphony of this unexpected encounter. Then, with a theatrical flair, I revealed my masterstroke – "I'll save your second name as One instead of Zion."

Her puzzled expression was the perfect canvas for the grand reveal. With a nerdy smile, I showcased my phone, unveiling the contact saved as "Chosen One" instead of the anticipated "Chosen Zion." The surprise on her face transformed into a mix of curiosity and amusement.

As I revealed the name "Chosen One" on my phone, I couldn't help but add a playful twist to the revelation. "You see," I grinned mischievously, "I've been on a mission; a quest to find the one. And here you are, Chosen One, ending my search." The words hung in the air, creating a moment of light-hearted comedy infused with a touch of romantic charm.

Her eyes widened in surprise, and a spark of laughter danced between us. It was more than a playful exchange; it was an acknowledgment that sometimes, in the most unexpected corners of life, we find the missing piece that completes our story. In that moment, the mundane act of saving a contact became a playful ritual, a declaration that the search was over. The name "Chosen One" was a creative whisper to the universe, acknowledging the uniqueness of this encounter and signaling that our paths had crossed for a reason. Little did we know that this playful exchange of names would set the stage for a narrative filled with chaos, shocks, and the undeniable trouble of Love at First Sight.

The exchange of contacts was like exchanging the first few pages of a book, each digit a symbol of a potential paragraph waiting to be written in the script of our unfolding story. In that exchange of numbers, we were laying the foundation for a connection that would go beyond casual encounters, leading us into a realm where every message, call, and shared moment would add depth to the evolving narrative of our love story.

The exchange of our tens, a small yet significant gesture in the digital age, became the first brushstroke on the canvas of our connection. Those numbers would become a lifeline, a channel via which conversations and secrets would flow. Who would have thought that a chance encounter, a shy smile, and exchanged digits could set the stage for a tale that embraced the unexpected connections? 

The campus, once a mere backdrop, now echoed with our shared chuckles, as if endorsing the creative reasoning behind the chosen nickname. In that instant, "Chosen One" became more than just a name in the contact list; it was a declaration, a wink to the universe that perhaps this encounter wasn't a random meeting but a destined connection. As we exchanged contacts, it felt like the beginning of a new chapter, one filled with the anticipation of getting to know each other beyond those initial glances.

And just like that, the pages of our shared narrative were ready to be written. In the world of romance, sometimes all it takes is a question, a smile, and the courage to step into the unknown. Contact details exchanged, the promise of future conversations hung in the air, and the rest, as they say, is history. 

It's funny how life takes unexpected turns, how chance encounters can lead to something far more profound. In the midst of the bustling campus, where academia usually takes the spotlight, our meeting became a subplot—a romantic twist that neither of us saw coming.

So fate played its hand, introducing me to this new girl who seemingly appeared out of nowhere. And just like that, we fell headfirst into the abyss of love. But let me tell you, love at first sight wasn't the gentle, poetic experience they show in movies. No sir, it was more like a romantic cinema with unexpected twists.

As we parted ways that day, the air was charged with the energy of a story in the making. Little did we know that a simple question and an even simpler answer had set the stage for a narrative that would evolve into something beyond our wildest imaginations. And so, the campus chase led not only to smiles but to the opening lines of a dialogue that would become the melody of our journey together. The beauty of beginnings lies in their simplicity, and ours was a tale that began with a question, a smile, and the unspoken promise of discovering each other's worlds. 

So there you have it, on that fateful day, I had crossed paths with this fellow student who, as fate would have it, was on her own quest for love too. It was like the universe planned a coincidence, bringing two love seekers together in the most unexpected manner. We shared glances, exchanged smiles, and before we knew it, our hearts were singing a duet. And there, amidst the campus hustle and bustle, we were swept off our feet and we found ourselves falling head over heels for each other.

Love, it seemed, had a peculiar sense of timing. Just when I thought I was taking matters into my own hands, destiny stepped in, creating a meeting that would alter the course of my romantic journey. In the midst of uncertainty, a spark ignited between us, and there and then, amidst the backdrop of the university campus, we fell headlong into the enchanting embrace of love.

Love at first sight? Well, maybe not exactly, but it was certainly a whirlwind romance that took us by surprise. Little did I realize that my quest for love was about to lead me down a path filled with unexpected twists, turns, and maybe a few heart-shaped potholes. So, fasten your seatbelt, dear reader, as we navigate the bumpy road of love at first sight—or something close to it! 

Oops! The bullet speed at which this love at first sight took off was enough to make Kiprotich or Inzikuru jealous! Little did I know, trouble had just decided to invite itself into my life, ready to pounce on my innocent heart. So, there I was, thinking I had stumbled upon the perfect love relationship outside the Bestie Zone with Lillian. As fate would have it, this newfound love interest wasted no time in turning my world upside down.

After encountering this new girl on campus, the one who seemed to have dropped from the sky at the exact moment I was on the lookout for love, things escalated faster than a Marvel movie plot. So, I met her at campus on Monday and before we could say "Friends," we were head over heels in love. Hmm…the mysteries of love at first sight! Anyways, we exchanged contacts and went our ways. 

On Tuesday the following day, this newfound love of mine decided to pay me a visit at my hostel. Now, any normal person would take it slow, but not her. Well, that was sweet, or so I thought.  Anyways, who doesn't love a surprise visit, right? But little did I expect that it would escalate so quickly. Things escalated quicker than a viral meme on social media. It was all rainbows and sunshine, with her expressing admiration for my living space. 

On Wednesday, she practically moved in with all her belongings - and no, not just with a toothbrush. She brought all her worldly possessions, making my tiny room look like a storage unit. I went from having a bachelor's crib to a shared space in the blink of an eye. It was like a whirlwind romance, but instead of being swept off my feet, I was caught in a tornado of unexpected events. I was still trying to make sense of the butterflies in my stomach when she decided to shift to my place!

Note to self: Next time, maybe wait until the second date before handing over the spare keys of the house. 

Now, I'm all for love, but I hadn't even had the chance to fully process the first meeting, and here she was, turning my bachelor's room into a love nest! I couldn't help but think, "Isn't moving in together usually a decision made after careful consideration and, you know, spending more than a week together?" But no, not in the world of love at first sight; in this universe, seems like moving in together was just another item to tick off the checklist. 

But wait, it gets even better. On Thursday, she dropped the bombshell – she was pregnant! Wait, what?! Imagine my shock! I needed a moment to process this information. I mean, wasn't this supposed to be the honeymoon phase? Apparently, not in the world of love at first sight. As in, the prospect of expecting parenthood after just a few days was a whole new level of speed dating. More like love at bullet speed!

Now, any sane person would raise an eyebrow at this breakneck speed of relationship milestones. The pace of this love story had reached a dangerous speed, and I was left wondering if I had accidentally stumbled into a love story that was on fast forward. Apparently, it seems like our love story had skipped a few chapters, and we were now expecting a bouncing baby! 

In the midst of this whirlwind romance, I couldn't help but think back to Lillian and the slow, steady pace we took. Maybe she was onto something with that whole "Besties with Crush" strategy. But no, I had decided to take the express train to love, and boy, was it a bumpy ride. I barely had time to locate the emergency exit in this fast-paced romantic comedy. Now, I don't know about you, but I'm the type who likes to take relationships at a leisurely pace. But here I was, hurtling towards marital bliss at rocket speed. Now, I'm not a mathematician, but the timeline didn't quite add up. 

But wait, there is more. Friday, she drops a curveball – she wants me to meet her parents. Yes, you read that right. Hold on, weren't we just figuring out how to pronounce each other's names? Now, don't get me wrong, I thought that meeting the parents is usually a milestone reserved for steady, long-term relationships. Talk about speedy commitment! Seriously, any rational person might think, "Whoa, slow down there!"

But in this case, it seemed like we were doing a marathon through relationship milestones at an Olympic pace. We hadn't even learnt the correct pronunciation of each other's name and here I was, about to face her family. Nevertheless, being the fearless film star in this love story, I played along and met her relatives.

To top it all off, on the sixth day, she casually mentioned that we should arrange for an introduction ceremony over the weekend. Yep, you heard that right – from meeting at campus to tying a knot in less time than it takes to order a pizza. Hold on, was this a setup or? Now, call me old-fashioned, but this was starting to feel more like a poorly scripted TV soap opera. I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all; was this what love at first sight truly meant?

In a blink of an eye, we went from strangers to meeting the parents, and the grand finale – a pregnancy announcement with wedding bells ringing in the background. I couldn't help but wonder if I'd stumbled into a movie plot on fast forward. Love at first sight, they said. More like love on a rocket ship to matrimony!

As the days unfolded, it became apparent that this whirlwind romance was spiraling out of control faster than a runaway train. The speed at which events were unfolding left me questioning the very nature of love at first sight. Was this some kind of a joke? Had I landed on a parallel universe where love and common sense played by a completely different set of rules?

I began to feel like a character in a poorly written romantic comedy – the kind where the protagonist finds themselves in increasingly awkward situations. It was as if the universe was playing a prank on me, testing just how much chaos could unfold in the name of love. So, there you have it, dear reader – the saga of my misadventures in the fast lane of love at first sight. As I reflect on those whirlwind days, I can't help but marvel at the absurdity of it all. Truth is: love, like fine wine, is best when savored slowly, not chugged down in one gulp. 

Lesson learnt: Love at first sight might sound dreamy, but sometimes, it's more like a runaway train heading to the land of chaos.
